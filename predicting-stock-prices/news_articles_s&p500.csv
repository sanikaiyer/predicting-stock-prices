Australia\'s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.6% to 7,966.50. South Korea\'s Kospi lost 0.5% to 2,513.17. Hong Kong\'s Hang Seng declined 0.3% to 22,005.16, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.4% to 3,309.12.\n\nCalling Trump\'s policy announcements ""headline turbulence,"" Tan Jing Yi of the Asia & Oceania Treasury Department at Mizuho Bank warned that global economies could be hurt in the long run, adding, ""Sentiments swing from hopes of intense relief to inflicted economic gloom.""\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 climbed 1.7% and added to its big gain from Tuesday that more than made up for a steep loss on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%.\n\nMuch of the recent market volatility is because of uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies. Adding to some relief was Trump saying late Tuesday that he has ""no intention"" to fire the head of the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump\'s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term.\n\nWhile a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Trump also said U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down ""substantially"" from the current 145%.\n\n""It won\'t be that high, not going to be that high,"" he said.\n\nInvestors are hoping Trump would lower his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries. Trump said this week that he would be ""very nice"" to the world\'s second-largest economy and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n""There is an opportunity for a big deal here,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.\n\nAll the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will ""more likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump\'s latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.\n\nThe S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration\'s officials continue to surprise markets.\n\nTrump\'s latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning.\n\nBig Tech helped lead indexes higher. Nvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. The chip company\'s stock was the strongest single force lifting the S&P 500.\n\nTesla revved 5.4% higher after CEO Elon Musk said he\'ll spend less time in Washington and more time running his electric vehicle company after Tesla on late Tuesday reported a big drop in profits. It\'s been struggling because of backlash against Musk\'s efforts to lead cost-cutting efforts by the U.S. government.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 88.10 points to 5,375.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 419.59 to 39,606.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 407.63 to 16,708.05.\n\nIn energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 25 cents to$62.52 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 26 cents to $66.38 a barrel.\n\nIn currency trading, the U.S. dollar slipped to 142.73 Japanese yen from 143.15 yen.

Trump would like Powell to be ""a little more active"" when it comes to cutting interest rates.\n\nOn his social media platform Truth Social, the president on Monday blasted the Fed chair as ""a major loser"" and ""Mr. Too Late,"" blaming Powell for not being responsive to his repeated demands to lower the interest rates.\n\nTrump claimed that Powell has always been too slow to cut rates, warning that ""there can be a SLOWING of the economy.""\n\nTrump also accused Powell of slashing rates in an attempt to help Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in their presidential campaign against him last fall. Trump said the Fed chair is now dragging his feet on moves that could aid his second-term agenda.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has said he is ""not happy with"" his selection of Powell for the head of the central bank. He reportedly discussed firing Powell in his first term and repeated Thursday that ""Powell\'s termination cannot come fast enough!""\n\n""If I want him out, he\'ll be out of there real fast, believe me,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday.\n\nWHAT\'S BEHIND THE ATTACKS?\n\nAnalysts said Trump\'s attacks on Powell signal an attempt to scapegoat the central bank for impending economic weakness caused by the president\'s tariff policies.\n\nTrump\'s trade war ""against almost every country on Earth is going badly,"" wrote The Atlantic. ""The trade war is ... scaring investors into dumping dollar-denominated assets. U.S. bond prices are falling, and the value of the dollar itself is tumbling.""\n\n""As Trump\'s policies wreak havoc, the policies\' author needs an excuse and someone to blame. Powell is that someone,"" it noted.\n\nThis was echoed by The Wall Street Journal. ""It\'s tempting to want somebody else to ride to the rescue, or at least have someone else to blame,"" the paper quoted former U.S. Senator Phil Gramm as saying.\n\nThe Atlantic piece pointed out that Trump treats interest rate cuts as a cure-all for his own economic mistakes, highlighting that when his trade war rattled markets in late 2018, he pressured the Fed to slash rates to bail him out.\n\nHowever, the Fed\'s responsibility is to maintain price stability. According to The Atlantic, if the Fed lowers short-term interest rates during inflation, it may spook investors into expecting worse to come, driving up long-term rates.\n\n""The rescue that the economy needs is a change not in monetary policy but in Trump\'s economic aggression against trading partners,"" it said. ""End the tariffs, let trade recover, and then the Fed can do its convalescent work.""\n\nCAN TRUMP FIRE POWELL?\n\nThe Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which established the Fed, stipulates that members of the Board of Governors -- appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to staggered 14-year terms -- can only be removed for ""cause,"" a standard long understood to mean misconduct rather than policy disagreements.\n\nPowell has consistently steered clear of political commentary, avoiding direct criticism of Trump and emphasizing the importance of the Fed\'s independence.\n\nWhen asked whether the president has the authority to fire him, Powell has maintained that the law does not allow it. While the matter is somewhat open to legal debate, most scholars agree with Powell\'s interpretation, barring extraordinary circumstances such as illegal behavior.\n\nAlthough it is hard to predict whether Trump would proceed with the removal of Powell, damage from the sheer uncertainty has already come into view.\n\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest U.S. companies, fell roughly 2.4 percent on Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite dropped around 2.5 percent respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar, which is supposed to be a safe asset in times of market turmoil, failed to escape the recent turbulence, sliding to its lowest level since 2022.\n\nAny attempt by Trump to sack Powell would likely spark a sharp sell-off in U.S. equity markets, Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI, told CNBC on Monday.\n\n""If you start to raise questions about Federal Reserve independence, you are raising the bar for the Federal Reserve to cut. If you actually did try to remove the Federal Reserve chairman, I think you would see a severe reaction in markets with (bond) yields higher, dollars lower, and equities selling off,"" said Guha. ""I can\'t believe that that\'s what the administration is trying to achieve.""\n\nIn line with Guha\'s remarks, The Wall Street Journal said in Monday\'s report that even if Powell is not ultimately ousted, Trump\'s efforts to discredit him could do lasting harm to an institution that has long sought to remain apolitical and technocratic.■', 'source': {'uri': 'independent.co.ug', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Independent Uganda:'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.independent.co.ug/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trump-tariffs-c.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-10544506', 'sentiment': -0.3333333333333334, 'wgt': 483160527, 'relevance': 1}",60152,1,100,602

U.S. stocks rallied on hopes that the two countries might lower the steep trade barriers they have erected over the past month, though there was no sign that negotiations might start anytime soon. Bessent said the tariffs - 145% on Chinese products and 125% on U.S. products - would have to come down before trade talks can proceed, but said Trump would not make that move unilaterally. ""Neither side believes that these are sustainable levels. As I said yesterday, this is the equivalent of an embargo and a break between the two countries in trade does not suit anyone\'s interest,"" Bessent told reporters. The White House is open to discussing a significant rate cut on Chinese imports in order to advance negotiations with Beijing but will not do so alone, according to a person familiar with the conversations. That person would not say how low the White House might be willing to go, but the Wall Street Journal reported the figure could be as low as 50%. A White House spokesperson dismissed any reports as ""pure speculation,"" and said news on tariffs would come from Trump himself. ""We are going to have a fair deal with China,"" Trump told reporters, but did not outline any specifics. The tariff levels outlined in the Journal report would likely still be high enough to deter a significant chunk of trade between the world\'s two largest economies. German shipper Hapag-Lloyd said Wednesday that 30% of its U.S.-bound shipments from China have been cancelled. Separate talks between the two countries over tackling the fentanyl epidemic have not yielded results so far, sources say. The apparent U.S. softening on China tariffs was a welcome sign for markets battered by Trump\'s erratic trade policies. The benchmark S&P 500 finished the day 1.67% higher at 5,375.86, but is still more than 12% below its February record close. ""It\'s about all of the political and policy uncertainty and what it could mean for the economy in the near term,"" said Jim Baird of Plante Moran Financial Advisors. Bessent said the third quarter of this year is a ""reasonable estimate"" for achieving clarity on the ultimate level of Trump\'s tariffs. In addition to the steep tariffs on China, Trump has also imposed a blanket 10% tariff on all other U.S. imports and higher duties on steel, aluminum and autos. He has suspended targeted tariffs on dozens of other countries until July 9 and floated additional industry-specific levies on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. That has roiled financial markets and raised fears of recession. On Wednesday, the Trump administration said in a Federal Register post that it had launched a probe into whether imports of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts for them pose a national security risk, a precursor to imposing tariffs on them. At the same time, Trump is planning to spare carmakers from some tariffs, The Financial Times reported, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. The move would exempt car parts from the tariffs Trump is imposing on China over fentanyl and also from tariffs on steel and aluminum, the report said. The European Union, which Trump has threatened with 20% tariffs, would respond with countertariffs if it cannot reach a deal with the United States before the July 9 deadline, economy minister Valdis Dombrovskis said on Wednesday. He said the 27-member trade bloc has offered to buy more liquefied natural gas from the United States and reduce tariffs on certain goods. Other countries are looking to negotiate as well. Vietnam\'s trade minister spoke to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday, state media reported. Twelve states, including New York, Arizona and Illinois, filed suit against the Trump administration on Wednesday in the U.S. Court of International Trade claiming that tariffs established through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal. The states joined California, which filed a separate suit against the government last week, in challenging the tariffs.', 'source': {'uri': 'thedailyherald.sx', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Daily Herald'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'editorial_dept@thedailyherald.sx', 'name': 'Editorial Dept.', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.thedailyherald.sx/images/2025/04/23/tariffs china_large.jpg', 'eventUri': 'zho-1808748', 'sentiment': -0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 483160301, 'relevance': 1}",60152,1,100,602

He has nothing to boast about,"" wrote Trump, adding that ""The situation for Ukraine is dire - He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country.""\n\nTrump also noted that the statement made by Zelensky would do nothing but prolong the ""killing field"" and ""nobody wants that!""\n\n""We are very close to a Deal, but the man with \'no cards to play\' should now, finally, GET IT DONE,"" he noted.\n\nChina\'s commitment ""extremely important"" for global climate action: UN chief\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday that China\'s newly announced commitment to cutting emissions goals is ""extremely important"" for global climate action.\n\nGuterres made the remarks after the virtual summit, the Leaders Meeting on Climate and the Just Transition, aimed at accelerating global climate ambition ahead of COP30, which will be held in Belem, Brazil, later this year.\n\nThe UN chief and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva gathered 17 leaders of large economies and small islands to discuss stronger commitments for their 2035 emission goals.\n\nWhen asked about any progress made in the meeting, Guterres said that China has not only announced that it would produce its NDCs, but that those NDCs would cover all economic sectors and all greenhouse gases.\n\n""It\'s the first time that China clarifies this point, and this is extremely important for climate action,"" he added.\n\nInjuries in Istanbul earthquake rise to 236 as citywide safety measures rolled out\n\nThe number of injuries from Wednesday\'s 6.2-magnitude earthquake in Istanbul has risen to 236, according to Health Minister Kemal Memisoglu.\n\nThe injuries were mostly caused by panic and individuals jumping from heights during the quake, according to the minister.

Australia\'s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.6% to 7,966.50. South Korea\'s Kospi lost 0.5% to 2,513.17. Hong Kong\'s Hang Seng declined 0.3% to 22,005.16, while the Shanghai Composite gained 0.4% to 3,309.12.\n\nCalling Trump\'s policy announcements ""headline turbulence,"" Tan Jing Yi of the Asia & Oceania Treasury Department at Mizuho Bank warned that global economies could be hurt in the long run, adding, ""Sentiments swing from hopes of intense relief to inflicted economic gloom.""\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 climbed 1.7% and added to its big gain from Tuesday that more than made up for a steep loss on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%.\n\nMuch of the recent market volatility is because of uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies. Adding to some relief was Trump saying late Tuesday that he has ""no intention"" to fire the head of the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump\'s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term.\n\nWhile a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Trump also said U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down ""substantially"" from the current 145%.\n\n""It won\'t be that high, not going to be that high,"" he said.\n\nInvestors are hoping Trump would lower his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries. Trump said this week that he would be ""very nice"" to the world\'s second-largest economy and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n""There is an opportunity for a big deal here,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.\n\nAll the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will ""more likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump\'s latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.\n\nThe S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration\'s officials continue to surprise markets.\n\nTrump\'s latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning.\n\nBig Tech helped lead indexes higher. Nvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. The chip company\'s stock was the strongest single force lifting the S&P 500.\n\nTesla revved 5.4% higher after CEO Elon Musk said he\'ll spend less time in Washington and more time running his electric vehicle company after Tesla on late Tuesday reported a big drop in profits. It\'s been struggling because of backlash against Musk\'s efforts to lead cost-cutting efforts by the U.S. government.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 88.10 points to 5,375.86.

It can be a highly profitable wager if the market suddenly becomes more volatile, for example, if it crashes, but the fund\'s price constantly erodes due to how the fund is structured.\n\nVolatility is often measured by the CBOE Volatility Index, commonly known as the VIX. It\'s called ""the fear gauge"" since the index spikes when investors get nervous. The index historically moves inversely to the direction of the Standard & Poor\'s 500 Index. So a volatility ETF may be useful as a short-term hedge against a portfolio or as a one-way bet on the market\'s direction.\n\nHere are some of the best volatility ETFs and ETNs, with data as of April 22, 2025.\n\nThis ETN provides exposure to S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index Total Return. Because it\'s an ETN, holders have no principal protection and own unsecured debt of the company sponsoring the notes, Barclays Bank.\n\nThis fund tracks the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, which follows a portfolio of futures contracts with a weighted average of one month until expiration.\n\nThis ETN tracks the S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index Total Return. Because it\'s structured as an ETN, holders have no principal protection and own unsecured debt of the issuer, Barclays Bank.\n\nThis ETF tracks the S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index, which follows a collection of futures contracts with a weighted average expiration of five months.\n\nThis ETF tries to provide daily results that are one-half the inverse of the daily performance of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. In other words, if this index rose 1 percent in a day, the fund would aim to fall 0.5 percent. If the index fell 1 percent, this fund aims to rise 0.5 percent.\n\nA volatility ETF gives traders the ability to wager on the stock market\'s volatility. Unlike a typical ETF, which owns stock or options of actual companies, a volatility ETF uses complex financial instruments called derivatives (such as futures) to create a fund that rises in value when the market gets rocky. If the market does become more volatile, the fund may soar, often quickly.', 'source': {'uri': 'finance.yahoo.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Yahoo!

There was a noticeable increase of one thousand points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was extremely obvious. Despite the fact that the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both increased by 3%, investor confidence was regained.\n\nU.S. relations with China had been uneasy for weeks before the cuts to U.S. tariffs. Trump said the tensions that unsettled global markets were cooled, while tariffs would decrease substantially. This policy shift also paused the ""Sell America"" trade narrative that had been gaining traction.\n\nBitcoin, on the other hand,broke through $93,000, and the cryptocurrency market has been strong. Gold prices meanwhile fell below $3,300 as investors ditched riskier assets in favor of equities. All major indexes showed gains by April 23, according to a FactSet chart tracking U.S. stock indexes over three sessions.\n\nIn April, before that, Trump had suggested a 145% tariff on Chinese imports that economists said would effectively end most U.S. China trade. On April 10, the White House official confirmed the high rate of the tariff and fears of economic fallout.\n\nBy April 23, Trump\'s decision to lower tariffs had reversed the downward trend. It follows a period of negotiation in which business leaders had been pressing the government for relief from the effect of high tariffs on supply chains and consumer prices. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who had been under attack during the market turbulence, got a reprieve from the tariff reduction.\n\nPowell had signaled earlier the Federal Reserve\'s patience. On April 16, he said the Fed will wait to assess the impact of Trump\'s policies, including tariffs, before changing the rates. The rollback of the tariff alleviated immediate pressure on the Fed and allowed Powell to keep the central bank\'s current posture.\n\nSince Powell was appointed chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2018, Trump\'s relationship with Powell has been fraught.With regard to interest rates, Trump has regularly voiced his disapproval of Powell. In response to Powell\'s refusal to reduce interest rates on April 17, Trump referred to Powell as ""playing politics"" and even threatened to dismiss him. Powell has declared that he does not intend to leave the position earlier than the May 2026 that he is scheduled to retire from.\n\nThe tensions rose to a peak when Trump called for lower interest rates to boost economic growth in an uncertain time of trade. Trump suggested a different tone by April 22. He said he had no plans to fire Powell and acknowledged that the Fed had a role in keeping economic stability. In a time of market recovery, Trump was apparently conscious of how the backlash could come if he disrupted the Fed\'s independence.\n\nThe Fed\'s autonomy in monetary policy, too, was also backed by bipartisan support, which further added to the support for Powell\'s position. On April 23, the stock market went up sharply and boosted investor sentiment, as the dual gain of tariff reduction and Trump\'s softened stance on Powell was realized.\n\nThe broader economic context was also involved in this. Data from Nasdaq also shows that over the long term, Bitcoin has outperformed traditional assets such as gold and the S&P 500 with a return of 437,171 percent since 2011. This resilience in cryptocurrencies, along with the tariff news, encouraged investors to re enter equity markets.', 'source': {'uri': 'livebitcoinnews.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Live Bitcoin News'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'emily_john@livebitcoinnews.com', 'name': 'Emily John', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Trump_Picks_Crypto_Advocate_Brian_Quintenz_as_CFTC_Chairman_copy-600x333-1-200x200-1.webp', 'eventUri': 'eng-10544506', 'sentiment': 0.1450980392156862, 'wgt': 483159569, 'relevance': 3}",60152,1,100,602

The market had opened sharply higher on relief among investors after Trump backedaway from threats to fire the head of the Federal Reserveand said a deal with China was possible. The benchmark S&P 500 index was up roughly 3% in mid-morning trading.\n\nThe Journal reported that discussions remain fluid and several options are on the table. One option would be a tiered approach similar to one proposed by the House of Representatives committee on China late last year: 35% levies for items the U.S. deems not a threat to national security, and at least 100% for items deemed as strategic to America\'s interest, some of the people said. That bill proposed phasing in those levies over five years.\n\nIn addition to the steep tariffs on China, Trump has also imposed a blanket 10% tariff on all other U.S. imports and higher duties on steel, aluminum and autos. He has suspended targeted tariffs on dozens of other countries until July 9 and floated additional industry-specific levies on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.

That trimmed the S&P 500\'s gain Wednesday to 1.7%. The yen reversed two days of losses and the dollar weakened in early Asian trade. Gold jumped 1.4% in increased demand for the traditional safe-haven asset.\n\nGlobal equities and long-dated Treasuries rose on Wednesday on signs US President Donald Trump is rethinking the most-aggressive elements of his stances on trade and the Federal Reserve. The brief rally after wild gyrations underscores the new reality for investors that US policies on trade tend to shift without forewarning, making it impossible to make even short term forecasts on where the markets are headed.\n\n""I suspect that you\'re going to see more of this in the coming months as we see a ratcheting up and a pulling back up of trade tensions until we get some sort of an idea of what the future actually looks like,"" said Brent Schutte at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.\n\nTrump signaled that the US is going to have a fair deal with China, adding late Wednesday that the country may receive a new tariff rate in the next two to three weeks. The administration is also considering reducing tariffs on auto parts ahead of a May 3 deadline, according to the Financial Times.\n\nBessent said that Trump hasn\'t offered to take down US tariffs on China on a unilateral basis. Asked if there was no unilateral offer from the president to de-escalate, he said ""not at all.""\n\nThe Treasury secretary said that the administration is looking at multiple factors with regard to China beyond just tariffs -- including non-tariff barriers and government subsidies. He also said that the strongest relationship between Washington and Beijing is at the top, and that there was no timeframe for engagement. A full rebalancing of trade might take two to three years, he said.\n\nA critical signal gleaned from market participants in recent days is the clear sensitivity of the Trump administration to the financial markets, wrote Kyle Rodda, senior market analyst at Capital.com. He cited the 90-day tariff pause and the backflip about firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell as examples\n\n""For all of his clumsy policy-making and erratic behaviour, President Trump remains aware of the massive damage a financial meltdown would do to US power and economic growth,"" Rodda wrote. ""It doesn\'t remove the risk of a painful growth slowdown and slower stock prices. But it markedly reduces the odds of a catastrophic tail event.""\n\nIn Asia, China is set to issue the first batch of special sovereign bonds for the year on Thursday as part of the stimulus announced by authorities to soften the blow from simmering trade tensions with the US. The Ministry of Finance plans to raise 286 billion yuan ($39 billion) via a three-part issuance later in the day, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nIn commodities, oil held a decline as investors weighed the prospect of more OPEC+ supply and the fallout from trade tensions between the US and China.\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.', 'source': {'uri': 'swissinfo.ch', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'SWI swissinfo.ch'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'swi_swissinfo_ch@swissinfo.ch', 'name': 'Swi Swissinfo.Ch', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/wp-content/uploads/swissinfo-theme/swi-fallback-featured-image.jpg?ver=1742977926', 'eventUri': 'spa-3818644', 'sentiment': 0.07450980392156858, 'wgt': 483156972, 'relevance': 1}",60152,1,100,602

No, it won\'t be anywhere near that high. It\'ll come down substantially. But it won\'t be zero."" The president\'s softer tone towards China, despite no formal talks, was in stark contrast to his more combative rhetoric earlier in April.\n\nChina, on its part, has welcomed the talks, but has not ceded any ground. ""China\'s attitude towards the tariff war launched by the U.S. is quite clear: We don\'t want to fight, but we are not afraid of it.

The wave of fraudulent trading has reached ¥100 billion ($710 million) since it started in February and shows no signs of cresting.\n\nThe scams typically use the hacked accounts to buy thinly traded stocks both domestically and overseas, allowing anyone who has built up a position earlier to cash out at inflated values. In response, some Japanese securities firms have stopped processing buy orders for certain Chinese, US and Japanese stocks.\n\nEight of the country\'s biggest brokers including Rakuten Securities Inc. and SBI Securities Co. have reported unauthorized trading on their platforms. The breaches have exposed Japan as a potential weak point in efforts to safeguard markets from hackers.\n\nThey also threaten to undermine the government\'s push to get more people to invest for their retirement, particularly since some victims say they are baffled as to how their accounts were broken into and the securities companies have so far largely refrained from covering the losses.\n\nAlso Read\n\nFY26 could be a constructive year for FII flows: Pranav Haridasan, Axis Sec\n\nICICI Securities partners with TCS to upgrade retail trading platform\n\nPremium\n\nRevenue hit looms for all brokerages, says CJ George, CMD, Geojit Financial\n\nPremium\n\nResult preview: Retailers\' revenue likely to edge up in weak Q4FY25\n\nPremium\n\nUS tariff move on India: What Axis Bank and leading brokerages say\n\nMai Mori, a 41-year-old part-time worker, said her Rakuten Securities retirement account was hacked and used to buy Chinese stocks in a transaction that cost her ¥639,777, or about 12 per cent of her holdings. When she noticed, she contacted Rakuten, which told her to file a police report. However, the police in Aichi prefecture wouldn\'t accept a criminal complaint because they said she wasn\'t the victim -- Rakuten Securities was. Rakuten then told her that it wasn\'t at fault and therefore could not help her, according to Mori.\n\n""The police told me that in most fraud cases, the victims often end up having to just quietly accept the loss,"" said Mori. ""Basically, there\'s not much that can be done.""\n\nIn a response to questions from Bloomberg News on fraudulent transactions and Mori\'s case, a Rakuten spokesperson said ""we will continue to examine each case individually and respond in good faith."" SBI said it was listening to individual circumstances and responding promptly. SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. said it would review the circumstances of each affected customer and consider individual responses.\n\nMonex Group Inc. also said it would consider each case individually. Matsui Securities Co. said it will handle compensation in accordance with industry guidelines and Nomura Securities Co. said it would respond flexibly based on the individual circumstances of affected customers. Daiwa Securities Group Inc. said they are reviewing the matter of compensation related to unauthorized transactions. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. said it will listen to the circumstances of each case and respond promptly and sincerely. The police in Aichi did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nOne investor who asked not to be named to protect his privacy said he lost around 50 million yen when his account was hacked and used to buy both Japanese and Chinese individual stocks. The Tokyo resident in his mid-50s said an account notification suddenly popped up on his iPhone on the morning of April 16. Alarmed, he immediately called his brokerage and was told they could not freeze the account.\n\nEven though he had only ever purchased index funds that tracked the S&P 500 index and had never bought individual shares, his account was used to buy stocks on margin. Faced with plummeting prices, he chose to sell the securities on the 17th and 18th to avoid further losses. Since the stocks were bought with leverage, the brokerage said it would liquidate his holdings in the S&P to cover their losses.\n\nOne of the stocks the investor said was purchased using his account was DesignOne Japan Inc. On April 16, 5.8 million shares of the stock traded hands compared with a daily average of 194,000 shares over the last six months. Bloomberg was unable to independently confirm details of the transactions in the investor\'s account.\n\nJapan\'s government has told brokerages to engage in ""good faith"" discussions with clients about compensation for losses, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said on April 22.\n\nThe Japan Securities Dealers Association, the umbrella group for the country\'s securities firms, is also pushing its members to upgrade their systems to make multi-factor authentication mandatory. The group\'s chairman, Toshio Morita, criticized the failure to provide compensation for victims, while acknowledging that it was up to each firm to set their own policy.\n\n""It\'s not acceptable to issue a blanket denial of compensation,"" Morita said at a press conference on April 16. ""Firms must consider each customer\'s circumstances and respond appropriately.""\n\nCases of fraudulent trading jumped to 736 in the first half of April from 33 in February, according to Japan\'s Financial Services Agency, without saying how much the victims had lost. This puts the government\'s strategy of getting more people to invest at risk.\n\nAn expansion of a tax exemption program for small investments spurred a 20 per cent rise in Nippon Individual Savings Accounts as of the end of 2024 versus the previous year, according to the FSA. That momentum has slowed down and the government might not reach its target of having 34 million users in five years, according to Yusuke Maeyama, a researcher at NLI Research Institute.\n\n""Among people already using the system, including myself, there\'s a sense that the financial firms need to do their jobs properly,"" Maeyama said. ""For people who haven\'t been involved in investing, this can be intimidating. When issues like this come up, it just reinforces their fears.""\n\nThe criminals behind the scams are likely using techniques called adversary-in-the-middle and infostealers to gain access to the accounts, according to Nobuhiro Tsuji, a cybersecurity expert at SB Technology. The first method leverages both fake and legitimate websites to steal cookies, the small text files stored in web browsers that hold session data.\n\nThe attack typically begins by luring the user to a fake site via a phishing email or malicious ad. The fake site then redirects the user to the legitimate site, where their login credentials are intercepted. In some cases, the attackers create extremely elaborate interfaces -- for example, one side of the browser shows the real site while the other displays the fake one -- to deceive users.\n\nIn contrast, infostealers are a type of malware specifically designed to steal sensitive information such as IDs and passwords. Hidden in emails, malicious ads, or fraudulent websites, these programs can infect a user\'s device and silently exfiltrate all stored personal data -- often without the user ever realizing they\'ve been compromised. There have been at least 105,000 cases of leaked credentials in Japan, according to a study done by Macnica Security Research Center.\n\nOne weakness in Japan is the propensity for people to use browsers rather than mobile apps, which have better protection, according to Yutaka Sejiyama, the deputy director of Macnica. There has not been a similar surge in cases overseas.\n\nMany of the victims have described their losses online, including Mai Mori, who wrote a series of posts detailing the hacking of her account. Mori joined a group that shared information about their cases and bandied around the idea of jointly hiring a lawyer, but faced with the amount of time and effort it would require, she eventually left.\n\nInstead, she\'s considering closing her account with Rakuten but is unsure of which of its competitors to turn to. Face-to-face brokerages charge higher fees and she\'s worried they would pressure her to buy stocks she doesn\'t want. Either way, she feels trapped.\n\n""We are so powerless,"" said Mori.

Here's what to know"", 'body': 'As economic uncertainty deepens worldwide, gold prices have notched more and more record highs\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- As economic uncertainty deepens worldwide, gold prices have notched more and more record highs.\n\nThat\'s because gold sales can rise sharply when anxious investors seek ""safe havens"" for parking their money. Gold\'s current rally arrives as U.S. President Donald Trump \'s announces new tariffs on economic allies and foes alike, roiling financial markets and threatening to reignite inflation for families and businesses alike.\n\nOn Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said that outlooks for economies worldwide, including the U.S., have significantly worsened in the wake of Trump\'s sweeping tariffs and the uncertainty they have created. And Trump\'s recent threats suggesting he can remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have only put investors more on edge.\n\nIf trends continue, analysts say the price of gold could continue to climb into unprecedented territory.\n\nHere\'s what to know.\n\nWhat\'s the price of gold today?\n\nThe going price for New York spot gold hit a record $3,424.24 per troy ounce -- the standard for measuring precious metals -- as of close Monday. That\'s about $1,097 higher than a year ago.\n\nThe price of spot gold is up more than 30% since the start of 2025, per the data firm FactSet. By contrast, the stock market has tumbled. The benchmark S&P 500 is down over 12% this year.\n\nGold futures also reached a record early Tuesday, briefly surpassing the $3,500 mark for the first time before falling closer to $3,444 by mid-morning.\n\nWhy is the price of gold going up?\n\nA lot of it boils down to uncertainty. Interest in buying gold typically spikes when investors become anxious -- and there\'s been a lot of economic turmoil in recent months.\n\nThe heaviest uncertainty lies with Trump\'s escalating trade wars. The president\'s on-again, off-again new levy announcements and retaliatory tariffs from some of the nation\'s closest traditional allies have created a sense of whiplash for both businesses and consumers -- who economists say will foot the bill through higher prices.\n\nConsumer confidence and global economic outlooks have deteriorated as a result. On Tuesday, the IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%. And for the U.S. specifically, the fund expects growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7%. China, which currently faces the heaviest levies from the U.S., is also expected to see weakened growth.\n\nLast week, Trump also renewed threats suggesting he could remove Powell -- and has since stepped up his public criticism of the Fed chair for not cutting interest rates. Any attempt to unseat Powell would likely set off a crisis in global financial markets over fears that a less independent Fed could struggle to keep inflation under control -- making investors all the more anxious.\n\nOver the last year, analysts have also pointed to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid other ongoing geopolitical tensions, including the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.\n\nIs gold worth the investment?\n\nAdvocates of investing in gold call it a ""safe haven"" -- arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.\n\nStill, experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket. And not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isn\'t always the inflation hedge many say it is -- and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up -- meaning ""when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.""\n\nAnd even gold\'s current rally has seen some volatility. The price of spot gold fell for several days following Trump\'s sweeping ""Liberation Day"" announcement on April 2, for example.\n\nIf you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, it\'s important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.\n\nWyatte Grantham-philips, The Associated Press', 'source': {'uri': 'sudbury.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Sudbury.com'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@sudbury.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': True}, {'uri': 'wyatte_grantham_philips@sudbury.com', 'name': 'Wyatte Grantham-philips', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2025/04/486357be39c5c2a03548535ec49249611e664864283de173e301c49281e7c7bc.jpg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.2627450980392156, 'wgt': 483156220, 'relevance': 1}",60152,1,100,602

Some of those employees were previously approved for remote work.\n\nStates sue Trump over tariffs\n\nA dozen states sued President Donald Trump and his administration Wednesday, seeking a court order declaring that his new tariffs on foreign imports are illegal.

For 2025, IBM reiterated its expectation for $13.5 billion in free cash flow and at least 5% revenue growth at constant currency.\n\nMarkets climb after softer tariff talk\n\nStocks rose Wednesday on hopes that U.S.-China trade tensions could soon ease.

All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\nWarren Buffett has been at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway for decades. During his tenure, the conglomerate\'s share price has soared at a compound annual rate of about 20%. This easily crushes the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe best investment decision made by the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" at least based on the dollar figure of gains it has achieved, may have happened in the past decade. Shares of this dominant business are up 649% since the start of 2016, the year Buffett first started buying. Despite sizable stock sales, this company still represents 22% of Berkshire\'s $265 billion public equity portfolio as of April 17.\n\nShould you buy this stock right now? Understanding Buffett\'s thinking, as well as the current situation, could help you decide.\n\nChecking all the boxes\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, Warren Buffett may have made the most lucrative investing decision of his career. That was when he first decided to buy shares in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). This came as a surprise to the investment community at the time because the Oracle of Omaha typically shied away from making bets on tech-driven enterprises. However, the factors that contributed to his decision are clear.\n\nLooking through Berkshire\'s many holdings, you\'ll realize that Buffett appreciates companies with strong brands. Even a decade ago, Apple fit this category. It built a reputation for innovation, designing beautiful hardware devices powered by proprietary software that\'s incredibly easy to use. Apple was and is an aspirational brand.\n\nConsequently, the business has always positioned its products at the premium end of the market. Add this to Apple\'s branding, and it\'s no surprise the company has pricing power. This is one of Buffett\'s favorite traits. And it\'s supported by a powerful ecosystem strategy that combines Apple\'s products and services to keep customers locked in and loyal.\n\nBuffett generally won\'t invest in financially unsound companies. Apple is the furthest from this. In fiscal 2015, the year before Buffett bought shares for the first time, Apple reported a net profit margin of 23%. Fast forward to today, and that profitability is still evident. What\'s more, Apple generates more cash than it knows what to do with, even accounting for sizable share buybacks.\n\nFinally, the valuation certainly played a critical role. During the first quarter of 2016, Apple\'s shares traded at an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.6. With the benefit of hindsight, this looked like an absolute bargain. Berkshire has reaped the rewards of Buffett\'s decision to buy Apple stock.\n\nIs now a good time to buy Apple?\n\nJust because an investment worked out well in the past and still has the endorsement of a legendary investor doesn\'t mean the stock is an automatic buy right now. It\'s best to view things with a fresh perspective.\n\nApple shares have been getting hit recently due to fears about the economic landscape. They are down 24% from their peak. However, the valuation still looks expensive.\n\nInvestors can buy the stock at a P/E ratio of 31.3 as of today. This is three times what Buffett first paid. In other words, the market is fully aware of how great a business Apple is, providing investors with no margin of safety.\n\nPaying that kind of valuation would make sense if Apple were registering strong profit growth. This hasn\'t been the case, though. In fiscal 2024, earnings per share (EPS) declined. And over the next three fiscal years, consensus analyst estimates indicate the key metric will rise at a 9% annualized clip. That doesn\'t justify the current P/E multiple. It\'s smart to keep Apple on the watch list for now.', 'source': {'uri': 'fool.com.au', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Motley Fool Australia'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://www.fool.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Little-boy-in-the-green-apples-16_9-1200x675.jpg', 'eventUri': 'eng-10546070', 'sentiment': 0.1215686274509804, 'wgt': 483156058, 'relevance': 1}",60152,1,100,602

US stocks rose Wednesday as a worldwide rally came back around to Wall Street after President Donald Trump appeared to back off his criticism of the Federal Reserve and his tough talk in his trade war.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 1.7 percent and added to its big gain from Tuesday that more than made up for a steep loss on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5 percent.\n\nWall Street\'s gains followed strong moves higher for stocks across much of Europe and Asia. They also continued a dizzying, up-and-down run for financial markets as investors struggle with how to react to so much uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies.\n\nThe market\'s latest move was up in part because Trump said late Tuesday that he has ""no intention"" to fire the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump had been angry with Jerome Powell, whom Trump had called ""a major loser,"" because of the Fed\'s hesitance to cut interest rates.\n\nTrump\'s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term.\n\nWhile a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Economists say Trump\'s tariffs are likely both to slow the economy and to raise inflation, at least briefly.\n\nTrump may have recognized the market\'s fear about a move against Powell. He may also be looking to keep someone around whom Trump could blame later if the economy does fall into a recession, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.\n\n""Indeed, if the Fed cuts its policy interest rates aggressively, Trump would have little excuse for a recession apart from the pugnacity of his tariff policies,"" Wizman said.\n\nMarkets also rose after Trump said late Tuesday that US tariffs on imports coming from China could come down ""substantially"" from the current 145 percent. ""It won\'t be that high, not going to be that high,"" Trump said.\n\nThe hope along Wall Street has been that Trump would lower his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries, and Trump said Tuesday he would be ""very nice"" to the world\'s second-largest economy and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n""There is an opportunity for a big deal here,"" US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.\n\nIf Trump brings his tariffs down enough, investors believe a recession could be averted.\n\nUS businesses say they\'re already feeling the effects of the trade war. A preliminary reading of US business activity fell to a 16-month low, as the threat of tariffs helped push up prices charged for goods and services, according to S&P Global\'s latest survey released Wednesday.\n\nAll the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will ""more likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump\'s latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.\n\nThe S&P 500 remains 12.5 percent below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20 percent below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration\'s officials continue to surprise markets. On Wednesday alone, the S&P 500 charged to a 3.4 percent gain in the morning, only to more than halve that rise as the day progressed.\n\nTrump\'s latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. It\'s a turnaround from earlier this month, when spiking Treasury yields raised fears that Trump\'s actions were scaring investors away from the United States and weakening the US bond market\'s reputation as one of the safest places to keep cash.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38 percent from 4.41 percent late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26 percent earlier in the morning.\n\nOn Wall Street, Big Tech helped lead stock indexes higher.\n\nNvidia rose 3.9 percent to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said US restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. The chip company\'s stock was the strongest single force lifting the S&P 500.\n\nOther stocks in the artificial-intelligence technology ecosystem also drove higher. Vertiv Holdings, which traces its roots to the industry\'s first manufacturer of computer room air conditioning, jumped 8.5 percent after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said it\'s continuing to see accelerated demand from AI data centers.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, a company that makes servers used in AI, rose 7.6 percent. Palantir Technologies, which offers an AI platform for customers, climbed 7.3 percent.\n\nTesla revved 5.4 percent higher after CEO Elon Musk said he\'ll spend less time in Washington and more time running his electric vehicle company after Tesla late Tuesday reported a big drop in profits. It\'s been struggling because of backlash against Musk\'s efforts to lead cost-cutting efforts by the US government.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 88.10 points to 5,375.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 419.59 to 39,606.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 407.63 to 16,708.05.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 2.1 percent in France, 2.4 percent in Hong Kong and 1.9 percent in Japan. Stocks in Shanghai were an exception, where they dipped 0.1 percent.

The MSCI Latam stock index trades at about 8.77 times estimated earnings, compared with 11.57 for the MSCI gauge of EM stocks and 19.26 for the S&P 500.\n\n""If this is a growth scare, which is our view, then this is an investment opportunity and the global rotation out of the US into the rest of the world is just beginning,"" Laidler said.\n\nThe outcome of this year\'s presidential election in Chile is a main focus for investors in the South American nation. Money managers have started to bet on a political shift away from the left as polls for the November first round vote show centre-right candidate Evelyn Matthei as a front-runner.\n\nMeanwhile, Laidler said he\'s positive on Argentina\'s reform agenda as it could unlock a multi-year upside for the equity market. The latest International Monetary Fund deal and the lifting of capital controls also mark a ""big step forward,"" said Laidler, adding that Argentina is Bradesco BBI\'s top regional country pick.\n\nFor Brazil, the triggers will be next year\'s presidential elections and the central bank\'s easing cycle, which is predicted to start by the end of this year.

Catalysts including China\'s DeepSeek R-1 model, trade war concerns, and other sources of macroeconomic uncertainty have all caused big sell-offs, and the S&P 500 index is down roughly 9% even after regaining some ground recently. Meanwhile, the more growth-oriented Nasdaq Composite index is down approximately 13.5% across that stretch.\n\nWhile investors should be mindful of the added uncertainty and risks that can come with investing amid a volatile market backdrop, this year\'s sell-offs could create opportunities to build positions in stocks that can generate great returns over the long haul. With that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think these stocks are good buys after big valuation pullbacks in 2025.\n\nKeith Noonan (Reddit): Reddit (RDDT 5.50%) stock plummeted in February after the company published fourth-quarter results that arrived with weaker-than-expected user engagement metrics. The company\'s share price then continued to move lower in conjunction with trade-war developments and geopolitical risks. On the heels of these pressures, the stock is now down 52% from its high this year.\n\nDespite the sell-off, Reddit managed to grow revenue 71% year over year to reach $427.7 million in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, daily average unique users (DAUq) still increased 39% year over year to 101.7 million. That figure came in below the 103.1 million DAUq count called for by the average Wall Street estimate, but it still represented strong growth. Following its recent valuation pullback, Reddit stock looks like an underappreciated artificial intelligence (AI) play.\n\nCrucially, Reddit has emerged as a popular search platform and results destination, because the platform houses a wide repository of user generated answers to questions, and good answers to questions are typically given priority thanks to a voting system.\n\nReddit is also licensing its data for application programming interfaces (APIs) and the training of AI models, allowing customers to access real-time data streams of information from the platform for use in behavioral analysis and building applications and algorithms. Citing a report from International Data Corporation, Reddit sees the market for AI (excluding China and Russia) growing at a 20% compound annual growth rate from 2024 through 2027 and reaching $1 trillion at the end of the forecast period.\n\nThe company is using AI to make the content it delivers to users safer and more relevant, and it plans to make additional moves to promote localized content to users on its platform. In doing so, management thinks that it can help bolster its growth internationally and expand its reach around the globe. With the stock still down big, Reddit looks like a worthwhile investment ahead of the publication of its first-quarter results on May 1.\n\nLee Samaha (Hexcel): Hexcel (HXL 2.50%) stock is down 30% from its high in 2025, and it\'s not hard to see why. The lightweight carbon fiber composite company\'s sales are a function of its customers\' production, and its two largest customers are Boeing and Airbus, as well as their suppliers. That\'s wonderful when their production rates are booming, but not so good when supply chain issues are causing airplane production slowdowns.\n\nIndeed, as Hexcel\'s CEO Tom Gentile said on the recent first-quarter earnings call, ""2025 is turning out to be another year in which production rate increases for commercial aircraft will not meet initial expectations due to ongoing supply chain disruption.""\n\nAs such, on the earnings call, Hexcel lowered its full-year sales, earnings, and free cash flow (FCF) guidance. The culprit is the Airbus A350 program, where Hexcel started the year expecting to deliver 84 shipsets of composites (each shipset on the A350 is worth $4.5 million to $5 million) to Airbus in 2025, but now expects to deliver just 68. It\'s not good news, and the market wasted no time pricing it in.\n\nBut here\'s the thing: Boeing and Airbus still have multiyear backlogs. Moreover, as Gentile noted, Hexcel can already support higher production rates. This means its cash flow will grow significantly when sales start improving, with an eventual increase in airplane production, because it doesn\'t need to ramp up capacity significantly.\n\nThe company also tends to source locally for its production in the U.S. and Europe, so tariffs, as they stand, aren\'t a significant issue (management estimates a hit of $3 million to $4 million a quarter, which it can offset with productivity improvements). Finally, the revised guidance for 2025 of adjusted diluted earnings of $1.85 to $2.05 and FCF of $190 million leaves the stock trading at about 25 times earnings and 20 times FCF in 2025. That\'s a good value for a stock with excellent long-term growth prospects.', 'source': {'uri': 'fool.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Motley Fool'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'keith_noonan@fool.com', 'name': 'Keith Noonan', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}, {'uri': 'lee_samaha@fool.com', 'name': 'Lee Samaha', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/815920/gettyimages-1352607170-1.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': -0.01960784313725494, 'wgt': 483155096, 'relevance': 1}",60152,1,100,602

As I said yesterday, this is the equivalent of an embargo and a break between the two countries in trade does not suit anyone\'s interest,"" Mr. Bessent told reporters.\n\nThe White House is open to discussing a significant rate cut on Chinese imports in order to advance negotiations with Beijing but will not do so alone, according to a person familiar with the conversations. That person would not say how low the White House might be willing to go, but the Wall Street Journal reported the figure could be as low as 50%.\n\nA White House spokesperson dismissed any reports as ""pure speculation,"" and said news on tariffs would come from Trump himself.\n\n""We are going to have a fair deal with China,"" Mr. Trump told reporters, but did not outline any specifics.\n\nThe tariff levels outlined in the Journal report would likely still be high enough to deter a significant chunk of trade between the world\'s two largest economies. German shipper Hapag-Lloyd said Wednesday that 30% of its U.S.-bound shipments from China have been canceled.\n\nSeparate talks between the two countries over tackling the fentanyl epidemic have not yielded results so far, sources say.\n\nThe apparent U.S. softening on China tariffs was a welcome sign for markets battered by Trump\'s erratic trade policies. The benchmark S&P 500 finished the day 1.67% higher at 5,375.86, but is still more than 12% below its February record close.\n\n""It\'s about all of the political and policy uncertainty and what it could mean for the economy in the near term,"" said Jim Baird of Plante Moran Financial Advisors.\n\nMr. Bessent said the third quarter of this year is a ""reasonable estimate"" for achieving clarity on the ultimate level of Trump\'s tariffs.\n\nIn addition to the steep tariffs on China, Mr. Trump has also imposed a blanket 10% tariff on all other U.S. imports and higher duties on steel, aluminum and autos. He has suspended targeted tariffs on dozens of other countries until July 9 and floated additional industry-specific levies on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. That has roiled financial markets and raised fears of recession.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration said in a Federal Register post that it had launched a probe into whether imports of medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts for them pose a national security risk, a precursor to imposing tariffs on them.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump is planning to spare carmakers from some tariffs, The Financial Times reported, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. The move would exempt car parts from the tariffs Trump is imposing on China over fentanyl and also from tariffs on steel and aluminum, the report said.\n\nThe European Union, which Trump has threatened with 20% tariffs, would respond with countertariffs if it cannot reach a deal with the United States before the July 9 deadline, economy minister Valdis Dombrovskis said on Wednesday. He said the 27-member trade bloc has offered to buy more liquefied natural gas from the United States and reduce tariffs on certain goods.\n\nOther countries are looking to negotiate as well. Vietnam\'s trade minister spoke to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday, state media reported.\n\nTwelve states, including New York, Arizona and Illinois, filed suit against the Trump administration on Wednesday in the U.S. Court of International Trade claiming that tariffs established through the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal. The states joined California, which filed a separate suit against the government last week, in challenging the tariffs.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said Wednesday the tariffs will slow growth and push debt higher across the globe. S&P Global found that U.S. business activity slowed to a 16-month low in April while prices charged for goods and services soared.\n\nThe Federal Reserve said it found economic activity in the United States to be steady over the past month, despite ""pervasive"" uncertainty around trade. The central bank\'s survey found a drop in international visitors in some areas, and the outlook in several of the Fed\'s 12 regional districts ""worsened considerably.""\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll found Americans souring on Trump\'s economic performance.

This compares to loss of $0.03 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 140%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this offshore oil and gas services contractor would post earnings of $0.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.13, delivering a surprise of 333.33%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.\n\nHelix Energy, which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, posted revenues of $278.06 million for the quarter ended March 2025, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.87%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $296.21 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nHelix Energy shares have lost about 30% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -10.1%.\n\nWhat's Next for Helix Energy?\n\nWhile Helix Energy has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Helix Energy: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.28 on $382.37 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.71 on $1.43 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Field Services is currently in the top 35% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Nine Energy Service (NINE), is yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2025. The results are expected to be released on May 7.\n\nThis oilfield services company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +37.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 30% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nNine Energy Service's revenues are expected to be $149.1 million, up 4.9% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nShould You Invest in Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%.\n\nWall Street\'s gains followed strong moves higher for stocks across much of Europe and Asia. They also continued a dizzying, up-and-down run for financial markets as investors struggle with how to react to so much uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies.\n\nThe market\'s latest move was up in part because Trump said late Tuesday that he has ""no intention"" to fire the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump had been angry with Jerome Powell, whom Trump had called ""a major loser,"" because of the Fed\'s hesitance to cut interest rates.\n\nTrump\'s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term.\n\nWhile a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Economists say Trump\'s tariffs are likely both to slow the economy and to raise inflation, at least briefly.\n\nTrump may have recognized the market\'s fear about a move against Powell. He may also be looking to keep someone around whom Trump could blame later if the economy does fall into a recession, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie.\n\n""Indeed, if the Fed cuts its policy interest rates aggressively, Trump would have little excuse for a recession apart from the pugnacity of his tariff policies,"" Wizman said.\n\nMarkets also rose after Trump said late Tuesday that U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down ""substantially"" from the current 145%. ""It won\'t be that high, not going to be that high,"" Trump said.\n\nThe hope along Wall Street has been that Trump would lower his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries, and Trump said Tuesday he would be ""very nice"" to the world\'s second-largest economy and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n""There is an opportunity for a big deal here,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.\n\nIf Trump brings his tariffs down enough, investors believe a recession could be averted.\n\nU.S. businesses say they\'re already feeling the effects of the trade war. A preliminary reading of U.S. business activity fell to a 16-month low, as the threat of tariffs helped push up prices charged for goods and services, according to S&P Global\'s latest survey released Wednesday.\n\nAll the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will ""more likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump\'s latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,"" said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.\n\nThe S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration\'s officials continue to surprise markets. On Wednesday alone, the S&P 500 charged to a 3.4% gain in the morning, only to more than halve that rise as the day progressed.\n\nTrump\'s latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. It\'s a turnaround from earlier this month, when spiking Treasury yields raised fears that Trump\'s actions were scaring investors away from the United States and weakening the U.S. bond market\'s reputation as one of the safest places to keep cash.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning.\n\nOn Wall Street, Big Tech helped lead stock indexes higher.\n\nNvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. The chip company\'s stock was the strongest single force lifting the S&P 500.\n\nOther stocks in the artificial-intelligence technology ecosystem also drove higher. Vertiv Holdings, which traces its roots to the industry\'s first manufacturer of computer room air conditioning, jumped 8.5% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said it\'s continuing to see accelerated demand from AI data centers.\n\nSuper Micro Computer, a company that makes servers used in AI, rose 7.6%. Palantir Technologies, which offers an AI platform for customers, climbed 7.3%.\n\nTesla revved 5.4% higher after CEO Elon Musk said he\'ll spend less time in Washington and more time running his electric vehicle company after Tesla on late Tuesday reported a big drop in profits. It\'s been struggling because of backlash against Musk\'s efforts to lead cost-cutting efforts by the U.S. government.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 88.10 points to 5,375.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 419.59 to 39,606.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 407.63 to 16,708.05.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 2.1% in France, 2.4% in Hong Kong and 1.9% in Japan.

Boeing also reaffirmed its full-year delivery and cash flow targets, helping reassure investors after a series of high-profile setbacks and production slowdowns.\n\nBefore this earnings release, markets were already watching Boeing closely amid renewed scrutiny of its aircraft output and delivery cadence. A fresh geopolitical twist added further pressure: China has reportedly asked its airlines to halt deliveries of Boeing jets and American aircraft parts in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. While this move is unlikely to affect this quarter's results, it casts a shadow over Boeing's long-term order book, given that China is among its most important growth markets.\n\nThe stock market, however, is focusing on the good news, not the bad. Boeing is a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, where it makes up around 3% of the price-weighted index, and also represents around 3% of the S&P 500 industrials sector, meaning its gains are helping lift broader benchmarks on Wednesday. Given the company's substantial role in its sector, its stock performance is often closely watched by investors and read as an indicator of broader industrial trends.\n\nSo it matters that Boeing's stock is still down nearly 30% for the year as of this week, reflecting investor concern about safety issues, production bottlenecks, and global demand. But Wednesday's report offers a much-needed sign of stability -- or at least breathing room -- for one of America's most iconic manufacturers.\n\nWhether the rally sticks will hinge on Boeing's ability to thread the needle -- easing global trade friction while proving it can get planes out the door faster, safer, and on time."", 'source': {'uri': 'dnyuz.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'DNyuz'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Boeing-stock-jumps-after-surprise-earnings-beat-despite-China-tensions.jpg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2470588235294118, 'wgt': 483154845, 'relevance': 1}",60152,1,100,602

Some of those employees were previously approved for remote work.\n\nStates sue Trump over tariffs\n\nA dozen states sued President Donald Trump and his administration Wednesday, seeking a court order declaring that his new tariffs on foreign imports are illegal.

Over the coming days, tens of thousands of people are expected to pass through, and the Vatican said it may extend the viewer hours even longer due to high turnout. In the first 8 1/2 hours, 19,430 people paid their respects to the pope.\n\nFrancis was laid out in red robes, clasping a rosary and wearing a bishop\'s miter, the traditional pointed headdress. Mourners waited hours to reach the casket, which was behind a cordon. Some held their cell phones aloft as they neared to snap photos in what has become a modern ritual.\n\n""It gave me chills,"" said Ivenes Bianco, as she left. She was in Rome from the southern city of Brindisi for medical care, and came to pay her respects. ""He was important to me because he encouraged co-existence. He brought many people together.\'\'\n\nFrancis\' casket wasn\'t put on an elevated bier -- as was the case with past popes -- but placed on a ramp, facing the pews. It was in keeping with his wishes for the rituals surrounding a papal funeral to be simplified to reflect his belief that the pope\'s role is that of simple pastor, not world leader.\n\nTrump says Zelenskyy is prolonging war in Ukraine by resisting calls to cede Crimea to Russia\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at Ukraine\'s president, saying Volodymyr Zelenskyy is prolonging the ""killing field"" after pushing back on ceding Crimea to Russia as part of a potential peace plan.\n\nZelenskyy on Tuesday ruled out ceding territory to Russia in any deal before talks set for Wednesday in London among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials. ""There is nothing to talk about. It is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,"" Zelenskyy said.\n\nDuring similar talks last week in Paris, U.S. officials presented a proposal that included allowing Russia to keep control of occupied Ukrainian territory as part of a deal, according to a European official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump called Zelenkyy\'s pushback ""very harmful"" to talks.\n\n""Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn\'t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?"" he wrote on social media.\n\nIsraeli strike in Gaza kills 23 as Arab mediators seek long-term truce\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- An overnight Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City killed 23 people, as Arab mediators worked on a proposal to end the war with Hamas that would include a five-to-seven-year truce and the release of all remaining hostages, officials said Wednesday.\n\nThere was no immediate Israeli comment on the strike, which set several tents ablaze, burning people alive. The military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters are embedded in densely populated areas. Another six people were killed in separate strikes, including 5-year-old twin girls.\n\nFrance, Germany and Britain meanwhile said Israel\'s seven-week blockade on all imports to Gaza, including food, was ""intolerable,"" in unusually strong criticism from three of the country\'s closest allies.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on Hamas to release the hostages in order to ""block Israel\'s pretexts"" for continuing the war. He reiterated his demands that Hamas give up their arms, referring to them as ""sons of dogs"" in unusually strong language during a speech in the West Bank.\n\nAbbas, who heads the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, has no influence over Hamas but seeks a role in postwar Gaza. Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said anyone making such insults has ""lost their physical, psychological and mental eligibility for these leadership positions.""\n\nA dozen states sue the Trump administration to stop tariff policy\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A dozen states sued the Trump administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York on Wednesday to stop its tariff policy, saying it is unlawful and has brought chaos to the American economy.\n\nThe lawsuit said the policy put in place by President Donald Trump has been subject to his ""whims rather than the sound exercise of lawful authority.""\n\nIt challenged Trump\'s claim that he could arbitrarily impose tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The suit asks the court to declare the tariffs to be illegal, and to block government agencies and its officers from enforcing them.\n\nA message sent to the Justice Department for comment was not immediately returned.\n\nThe states listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit were Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont.\n\nWall Street rises and markets rally worldwide as Trump softens his tough talk on tariffs and the Fed\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as a worldwide rally came back around to Wall Street after President Donald Trump appeared to back off his criticism of the Federal Reserve and his tough talk in his trade war.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 1.7% and added to its big gain from Tuesday that more than made up for a steep loss on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%.\n\nWall Street\'s gains followed strong moves higher for stocks across much of Europe and Asia. They also continued a dizzying, up-and-down run for financial markets as investors struggle with how to react to so much uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies.\n\nThe market\'s latest move was up in part because Trump said late Tuesday that he has ""no intention"" to fire the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump had been angry with Jerome Powell, whom Trump had called ""a major loser,"" because of the Fed\'s hesitance to cut interest rates.\n\nTrump\'s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term.\n\nA magnitude 6.2 quake shakes Istanbul and injures more than 230 people\n\nISTANBUL (AP) -- An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2 shook Istanbul and other areas of Turkey on Wednesday, prompting widespread panic and scores of injuries in the city of 16 million people, though there were no immediate reports of serious damage.\n\nAt least 236 people were treated for injuries they suffered while trying to jump from buildings or for panic attacks -- most of them in Istanbul, where residents are on tenterhooks because the city is considered at high risk for a major quake.\n\nThe earthquake had a shallow depth of 10 kilometers (about 6 miles), according to the United States Geological Survey, with its epicenter about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Istanbul, in the Sea of Marmara.\n\nIt was felt in the neighboring provinces of Tekirdag, Yalova, Bursa and Balikesir and in the coastal city of Izmir, some 550 kilometers (340 miles) south of Istanbul. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the earthquake lasted 13 seconds and was followed by more than 100 aftershocks -- the strongest measuring 5.9 in magnitude.\n\nThe quake started at 12:49 p.m. Wednesday, a public holiday, when many children were out of school and celebrating in the streets of Istanbul. Panicked residents rushed from their homes and buildings into the streets. Authorities urged residents to avoid entering buildings that might have been damaged and said sports halls and mosques would be open to house residents not wanting to spend the night in their homes.\n\nIndia blames Pakistan for a deadly attack in Kashmir and suspends a key water treaty\n\nSRINAGAR, India (AP) -- India blamed Pakistan on Wednesday for a militant attack that killed 26 people in Indian-held Kashmir, downgrading diplomatic ties and suspending a crucial water-sharing treaty that has withstood two wars between the nuclear-armed rivals.\n\nThe spray of gunfire at tourists Tuesday in a scenic, mountain-ringed valley was the worst assault in years targeting civilians in the restive region that is claimed by both countries. The unidentified gunmen also wounded 17 other people.\n\nIndia\'s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, announced the diplomatic moves against Pakistan at a news conference in New Delhi late Wednesday, saying a special cabinet meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided that the attack had ""cross-border"" links to Pakistan. However, the government provided no evidence of this publicly.\n\nPakistan said it would respond more fully to India\'s actions on Thursday, but in the meantime Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad said that India was using ""an unfortunate incident of terrorism"" as a pretext to jettison a treaty it has long been trying to evade.\n\nIndia describes militancy in Kashmir as Pakistan-backed terrorism. Pakistan denies this, and many Muslim Kashmiris consider the militants to be part of a home-grown freedom struggle.\n\nRemains of mom, child found near Gilgo Beach ID\'d, though deaths may be unrelated to serial killings\n\nMINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- A woman and toddler whose remains were discovered scattered along an oceanfront highway not far from the victims of Long Island\'s infamous Gilgo Beach killings were identified Wednesday as a U.S. Army veteran from Alabama and her daughter.\n\nTanya Denise Jackson, 26, of Mobile, had been living in Brooklyn with her 2-year-old daughter, Tatiana Marie Dykes, at the time of their deaths, Nassau County police announced.\n\nJackson, who police say may have worked as a medical assistant, had been previously nicknamed ""Peaches"" by investigators after a tattoo on her body.\n\nHer identity had been a mystery for nearly 28 years. For roughly half that time, investigators have sought to determine whether she and her daughter were victims of the same killer, or killers, who left the bodies of several other people strewn in the sand along the parkway that runs the length of Jones Beach Island.\n\nPolice said Wednesday that they had no evidence at this point linking the mother and daughter\'s deaths to Rex Heuermann, who has been charged in the deaths of seven women whose remains were discovered elsewhere on the beach road and other parts of Long Island.\n\nKnicks star Jalen Brunson wins NBA\'s clutch player of the year award\n\nJalen Brunson made more baskets than anyone else in the NBA this season when games were considered to be on the line.\n\nHe delivered in the clutch. And a trophy is coming his way.\n\nBrunson, the New York Knicks\' star guard, won the NBA\'s clutch player of the year award on Wednesday. He got 70 of the 100 first-place votes, easily beating second-place Nikola Jokic of Denver and third-place Anthony Edwards of Minnesota.\n\n""I think some people are born into it,"" Brunson said on TNT shortly after the results were revealed. ""I think I had to learn. I learned back in high school, kind of got better and better at each stage, and here we are.""\n\nBrunson -- who made a league-best 52 field goals in clutch time -- averaged 5.6 points on 51.5% shooting in those moments, with the Knicks going 17-11 in the games he played that met the criteria for the ""clutch"" designation.\n\nInternational students stripped of legal status in the US are piling up wins in court\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Anjan Roy was studying with friends at Missouri State University when he got an email that turned his world upside down. His legal status as an international student had been terminated, and he was suddenly at risk for deportation.\n\n""I was in literal shock, like, what the hell is this?"" said Roy, a graduate student in computer science from Bangladesh.\n\nAt first, he avoided going out in public, skipping classes and mostly keeping his phone turned off. A court ruling in his favor led to his status being restored this week, and he has returned to his apartment, but he is still asking his roommates to screen visitors.\n\nMore than a thousand international students have faced similar disruptions in recent weeks, with their academic careers -- and their lives in the U.S. -- thrown into doubt in a widespread crackdown by the Trump administration.

DOGE now aims for just $150 billion in savings by fiscal 2026, short of the hundreds of billions Trump claimed he saved.\n\nNone of that matters to Tesla investors; all that matters is that Musk gets back to devoting most of his time to Tesla.\n\nLast year, the world finally got a glimpse of Elon Musk\'s vision of a fully autonomous future when Tesla unveiled the Cybercab last October.\n\nOptimus robots served drinks at the event on the Warner Bros. backlot in Los Angeles, and millions watched online as an army of gold, gull-wing doored coupes with no drivers, acceleration, or brake pedals queued up to take drunk passengers enjoying a night out home safely.\n\nWhile the tech behind the autonomous driving technology was the obvious star of the show, the appearance of the futuristic, concept car-looking Cybercab also caused a stir.\n\nFresh off the launch of the Cybertruck in November 2023, Tesla seemed to have just unveiled its next big hit.\n\nTesla has since promised that its robotaxi program, which it says would allow users to earn passive income by having Teslas run autonomously as taxis, would begin testing the streets of Austin, Texas, this summer.\n\nMusk reiterated that promise during Tuesday\'s call, but he also provided some bad news for people who were looking forward to the Cybercab.\n\n""We should parse out the terms for robotic taxi or robo taxi. We\'ve got a product called a Cybercab, and then any Tesla, which could be an S, 3, X, or Y - that is autonomous, is a robotic taxi or robo taxi,"" Musk said before immediately adding that the whole thing was ""very confusing.""\n\nBut the bottom line seems to be that if you own a Tesla with FSD capabilities, your vehicle could potentially be a robotaxi, starting in June in Austin.\n\nRelated: More surprising China news hits Tesla stock\n\nBut the Cybercab you saw in 2024 won\'t be part of that fleet.\n\nMusk didn\'t give a timeline for when we might see the vehicles; he only mentioned them to ""disambiguate"" them from the term \'robotaxi\'.\n\nTesla rises despite crumbling fundamentals\n\nCybercab or no Cybercab, Musk will have tons of work to catch up on once his focus is back on Tesla.\n\nThe company was forced to slash prices last year to work through a backlog of inventory. The strategy seemed to work, especially in the weeks following the November 2024 election.\n\nMore Tesla news:\n\nHowever, 2025 hasn\'t been as kind to the company, and Musk even acknowledged that his political activism was costing it in the short term.\n\nTesla reported a 20% year-over-year drop in automotive revenue to just under $14 billion, as global deliveries fell 13%.\n\nTesla reported overall revenue of $19.34 billion with adjusted earnings of 27 cents per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $21.43 billion with earnings of 44 cents per share.\n\nDespite the disastrous quarter for fundamentals, the stock jumped more than 5% in after-hours trading during the earnings call.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager unveils eye-popping S&P 500 forecast', 'source': {'uri': 'sacbee.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'The Sacramento Bee'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'tony_owusu@sacbee.com', 'name': 'Tony Owusu', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/hjn7kk/picture299891779/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/3b7c0e5e-5094-4ee7-a613-ccd0d4d5ec6e', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1450980392156862, 'wgt': 483154107, 'relevance': 1}",60152,1,100,602

Over the coming days, tens of thousands of people are expected to pass through, and the Vatican said it may extend the viewer hours even longer due to high turnout. In the first 8 1/2 hours, 19,430 people paid their respects to the pope.\n\nFrancis was laid out in red robes, clasping a rosary and wearing a bishop\'s miter, the traditional pointed headdress. Mourners waited hours to reach the casket, which was behind a cordon. Some held their cell phones aloft as they neared to snap photos in what has become a modern ritual.\n\n""It gave me chills,"" said Ivenes Bianco, as she left. She was in Rome from the southern city of Brindisi for medical care, and came to pay her respects. ""He was important to me because he encouraged co-existence. He brought many people together.\'\'\n\nFrancis\' casket wasn\'t put on an elevated bier -- as was the case with past popes -- but placed on a ramp, facing the pews. It was in keeping with his wishes for the rituals surrounding a papal funeral to be simplified to reflect his belief that the pope\'s role is that of simple pastor, not world leader.\n\nTrump says Zelenskyy is prolonging war in Ukraine by resisting calls to cede Crimea to Russia\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at Ukraine\'s president, saying Volodymyr Zelenskyy is prolonging the ""killing field"" after pushing back on ceding Crimea to Russia as part of a potential peace plan.\n\nZelenskyy on Tuesday ruled out ceding territory to Russia in any deal before talks set for Wednesday in London among U.S., European and Ukrainian officials. ""There is nothing to talk about. It is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,"" Zelenskyy said.\n\nDuring similar talks last week in Paris, U.S. officials presented a proposal that included allowing Russia to keep control of occupied Ukrainian territory as part of a deal, according to a European official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump called Zelenkyy\'s pushback ""very harmful"" to talks.\n\n""Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn\'t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?"" he wrote on social media.\n\nIsraeli strike in Gaza kills 23 as Arab mediators seek long-term truce\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- An overnight Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City killed 23 people, as Arab mediators worked on a proposal to end the war with Hamas that would include a five-to-seven-year truce and the release of all remaining hostages, officials said Wednesday.\n\nThere was no immediate Israeli comment on the strike, which set several tents ablaze, burning people alive. The military says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters are embedded in densely populated areas. Another six people were killed in separate strikes, including 5-year-old twin girls.\n\nFrance, Germany and Britain meanwhile said Israel\'s seven-week blockade on all imports to Gaza, including food, was ""intolerable,"" in unusually strong criticism from three of the country\'s closest allies.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on Hamas to release the hostages in order to ""block Israel\'s pretexts"" for continuing the war. He reiterated his demands that Hamas give up their arms, referring to them as ""sons of dogs"" in unusually strong language during a speech in the West Bank.\n\nAbbas, who heads the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, has no influence over Hamas but seeks a role in postwar Gaza. Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said anyone making such insults has ""lost their physical, psychological and mental eligibility for these leadership positions.""\n\nA dozen states sue the Trump administration to stop tariff policy\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A dozen states sued the Trump administration in the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York on Wednesday to stop its tariff policy, saying it is unlawful and has brought chaos to the American economy.\n\nThe lawsuit said the policy put in place by President Donald Trump has been subject to his ""whims rather than the sound exercise of lawful authority.""\n\nIt challenged Trump\'s claim that he could arbitrarily impose tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The suit asks the court to declare the tariffs to be illegal, and to block government agencies and its officers from enforcing them.\n\nA message sent to the Justice Department for comment was not immediately returned.\n\nThe states listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit were Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont.\n\nWall Street rises and markets rally worldwide as Trump softens his tough talk on tariffs and the Fed\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as a worldwide rally came back around to Wall Street after President Donald Trump appeared to back off his criticism of the Federal Reserve and his tough talk in his trade war.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 1.7% and added to its big gain from Tuesday that more than made up for a steep loss on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%.\n\nWall Street\'s gains followed strong moves higher for stocks across much of Europe and Asia. They also continued a dizzying, up-and-down run for financial markets as investors struggle with how to react to so much uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies.\n\nThe market\'s latest move was up in part because Trump said late Tuesday that he has ""no intention"" to fire the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump had been angry with Jerome Powell, whom Trump had called ""a major loser,"" because of the Fed\'s hesitance to cut interest rates.\n\nTrump\'s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term.\n\nA magnitude 6.2 quake shakes Istanbul and injures more than 230 people\n\nISTANBUL (AP) -- An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.2 shook Istanbul and other areas of Turkey on Wednesday, prompting widespread panic and scores of injuries in the city of 16 million people, though there were no immediate reports of serious damage.\n\nAt least 236 people were treated for injuries they suffered while trying to jump from buildings or for panic attacks -- most of them in Istanbul, where residents are on tenterhooks because the city is considered at high risk for a major quake.\n\nThe earthquake had a shallow depth of 10 kilometers (about 6 miles), according to the United States Geological Survey, with its epicenter about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Istanbul, in the Sea of Marmara.\n\nIt was felt in the neighboring provinces of Tekirdag, Yalova, Bursa and Balikesir and in the coastal city of Izmir, some 550 kilometers (340 miles) south of Istanbul. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the earthquake lasted 13 seconds and was followed by more than 100 aftershocks -- the strongest measuring 5.9 in magnitude.\n\nThe quake started at 12:49 p.m. Wednesday, a public holiday, when many children were out of school and celebrating in the streets of Istanbul. Panicked residents rushed from their homes and buildings into the streets. Authorities urged residents to avoid entering buildings that might have been damaged and said sports halls and mosques would be open to house residents not wanting to spend the night in their homes.\n\nIndia blames Pakistan for a deadly attack in Kashmir and suspends a key water treaty\n\nSRINAGAR, India (AP) -- India blamed Pakistan on Wednesday for a militant attack that killed 26 people in Indian-held Kashmir, downgrading diplomatic ties and suspending a crucial water-sharing treaty that has withstood two wars between the nuclear-armed rivals.\n\nThe spray of gunfire at tourists Tuesday in a scenic, mountain-ringed valley was the worst assault in years targeting civilians in the restive region that is claimed by both countries. The unidentified gunmen also wounded 17 other people.\n\nIndia\'s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, announced the diplomatic moves against Pakistan at a news conference in New Delhi late Wednesday, saying a special cabinet meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided that the attack had ""cross-border"" links to Pakistan. However, the government provided no evidence of this publicly.\n\nPakistan said it would respond more fully to India\'s actions on Thursday, but in the meantime Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad said that India was using ""an unfortunate incident of terrorism"" as a pretext to jettison a treaty it has long been trying to evade.\n\nIndia describes militancy in Kashmir as Pakistan-backed terrorism. Pakistan denies this, and many Muslim Kashmiris consider the militants to be part of a home-grown freedom struggle.\n\nRemains of mom, child found near Gilgo Beach ID\'d, though deaths may be unrelated to serial killings\n\nMINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) -- A woman and toddler whose remains were discovered scattered along an oceanfront highway not far from the victims of Long Island\'s infamous Gilgo Beach killings were identified Wednesday as a U.S. Army veteran from Alabama and her daughter.\n\nTanya Denise Jackson, 26, of Mobile, had been living in Brooklyn with her 2-year-old daughter, Tatiana Marie Dykes, at the time of their deaths, Nassau County police announced.\n\nJackson, who police say may have worked as a medical assistant, had been previously nicknamed ""Peaches"" by investigators after a tattoo on her body.\n\nHer identity had been a mystery for nearly 28 years. For roughly half that time, investigators have sought to determine whether she and her daughter were victims of the same killer, or killers, who left the bodies of several other people strewn in the sand along the parkway that runs the length of Jones Beach Island.\n\nPolice said Wednesday that they had no evidence at this point linking the mother and daughter\'s deaths to Rex Heuermann, who has been charged in the deaths of seven women whose remains were discovered elsewhere on the beach road and other parts of Long Island.\n\nKnicks star Jalen Brunson wins NBA\'s clutch player of the year award\n\nJalen Brunson made more baskets than anyone else in the NBA this season when games were considered to be on the line.\n\nHe delivered in the clutch. And a trophy is coming his way.\n\nBrunson, the New York Knicks\' star guard, won the NBA\'s clutch player of the year award on Wednesday. He got 70 of the 100 first-place votes, easily beating second-place Nikola Jokic of Denver and third-place Anthony Edwards of Minnesota.\n\n""I think some people are born into it,"" Brunson said on TNT shortly after the results were revealed. ""I think I had to learn. I learned back in high school, kind of got better and better at each stage, and here we are.""\n\nBrunson -- who made a league-best 52 field goals in clutch time -- averaged 5.6 points on 51.5% shooting in those moments, with the Knicks going 17-11 in the games he played that met the criteria for the ""clutch"" designation.\n\nInternational students stripped of legal status in the US are piling up wins in court\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- Anjan Roy was studying with friends at Missouri State University when he got an email that turned his world upside down. His legal status as an international student had been terminated, and he was suddenly at risk for deportation.\n\n""I was in literal shock, like, what the hell is this?"" said Roy, a graduate student in computer science from Bangladesh.\n\nAt first, he avoided going out in public, skipping classes and mostly keeping his phone turned off. A court ruling in his favor led to his status being restored this week, and he has returned to his apartment, but he is still asking his roommates to screen visitors.\n\nMore than a thousand international students have faced similar disruptions in recent weeks, with their academic careers -- and their lives in the U.S. -- thrown into doubt in a widespread crackdown by the Trump administration. Some have found a measure of success in court, with federal judges around the country issuing orders to restore students\' legal status at least temporarily.\n\nIn addition to the case filed in Atlanta, where Roy is among 133 plaintiffs, judges have issued temporary restraining orders in states including New Hampshire, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. Judges have denied similar requests in some other cases, saying it was not clear the loss of status would cause irreparable harm.', 'source': {'uri': 'santamariatimes.com', 'dataType': 'news', 'title': 'Santa Maria Times'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'associated_press@santamariatimes.com', 'name': 'Associated Press', 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/santamariatimes.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b9c888ca-59a2-11eb-a31f-0b4d74fa96dc.jpg?resize=200%2C200', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1529411764705881, 'wgt': 483154092, 'relevance': 1}",60152,1,100,602
