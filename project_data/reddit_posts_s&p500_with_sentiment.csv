According to the historical data shared by analysts, both the key indices have triggered a rare sell-off signal.

Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist of Carson Research, highlighted in an X post that if the S&P 500 closes down by 4% on Monday, it would mark the third consecutive day of a 4% or greater decline. He states that this has only happened three times in history, all during the Great Depression.

Similarly, Jason Goepfert, a consultant at White Oak Consultancy LLC, notes that futures indicate a loss greater than 3% for the Dow Jones. If this occurs, it would also be the third consecutive loss greater than 3%, which has only happened four times during the Great Depression.

You can expect an annualized return of 0% over the next 10 years, if you buy the S&P 500 today at a forward P/E of around 23. The data leaves no room for doubt.

My experience is that investors always know exactly what stocks they own, but far too rarely what they paid for them (in terms of the P/E ratio).

The price you pay for your stocks is directly linked to the returns you‚Äôll achieve‚Äîthis is a fundamental truth.

"Elliot Waves, GME, The S&P 500, Wen Market Peak and GME Boom?",possibly6,2021-06-15 01:34:29,"Sup Apes

Not Financial Advice

I'm so honored to finally have the Elliot Wave Guy flair!!! I post on twitter pretty consistently now, if you wanna see snippets of analysis and whatnot intraday (also in the event my reddit gets hacked) [https://twitter.com/gavinmayreal](https://twitter.com/gavinmayreal)

Please remember this is all just my theory, I can very well be wrong. I‚Äôm just an ape who want banana üçå 

This post isn't gonna be talking about GME's wave's as much, rather the broader market, and how we can use SPX (I'm gonna be referencing $SPY in this post, ETF that tracks the SP500, SPYDER GANG) as a gauge of when to expect some erratic GME movement.

I have one request before I begin, please blast this song while reading, it sets the mood: [https://youtu.be/MN3x-kAbgFU](https://youtu.be/MN3x-kAbgFU)

Okay then, hope everyone is having an amazing evening! I think it's a pretty safe assumption to assume that the majority of apes here understand the GME situation pretty well. What I'm gonna be focusing on in this post is how we can use elliot waves on SPY to not only predict the top of this absurd, seemingly endless bull market, but more importantly, how we can use these targets on the broader market in relation to GME.

We all know by now that GME is a negative beta stock. Simply put, **Beta** is a numeric value that measures the fluctuations of a stock to changes in the overall stock market. Beta measures the responsiveness of a stock's price to changes in the overall stock market. ... The volatility of the stock and systematic risk can be judged by calculating beta.

normal stocks have a positive beta, usually around 1.0, meaning if the market (SPY) drops 1 point, we can assume said ticker will drop 1 point as well. idk what GME's beta is as of now, though it's probably something ridiculously negative (anyone with a bloomberg terminal wanna lmk the actual beta?). I've seen numbers ranging from -5 to -40... needless to say, GME does indeed have a negative beta.

&#x200B;

[wut mean?](https://preview.redd.it/n7lrg439xb571.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=e51aed75d2fdb2b5569ef74f533758c86c96046a)

There have been many great thesis's drafted regarding GME boom = market crash, which I think are completely true. In short, the market crash makes GME moon, or GME moon causes the market crash. why? I know people have noticed the wild crip toe fluctuations and drops, this is partly attributed to capital requirements, meaning if shorts don't post collateral by x time on x date, marge comes a calling.

But think about the stock market. It's no secret that hedgies are also long certain stocks, after all they manage billions and billions of dollars. Citadel recent 13f: [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link)

Do note the last reported 13f is 3/31, reported quarterly.  

Interesting how their largest position reported is short SPY huh? Anyways, not much of a point digging through their holdings, you can if you want but I don't see it as a super useful way to spend your time.

if (when) the market takes a turn and enters a bear market, needless to say their long positions lose value. What happens when their long positions are suddenly worth less and they need to post collateral to avoid marge calling in... See where I'm going with this?

onto the wavvveeeesssssss

Below is a monthly view of SPY:

&#x200B;

[monthly](https://preview.redd.it/zcixym1ryb571.png?width=2806&format=png&auto=webp&s=77a13dc04e487c3bc835b2ce7effece18a133f5e)

This is our SUPER CYCLE, starting from the low of the 08 fin crisis. Now let's zoom in and see where we're at on a smaller scale:

&#x200B;

[4 hr compressed](https://preview.redd.it/uaddjcq9zb571.png?width=2798&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb59c92f783dea2038c2bbf9683035802e2b61ee)

Remember, the order for wave cycles is grand super cycle, super cycle, cycle, primary, intermediate, and so on. What's important is you can distinguish where we are at in any cycle. For SPY, we are actually in the 5th wave of our 5th wave of our 5th wave... can anyone tell me what that means?

I'll wait...

come on...

I know you know...

Okay fine I'll tell you. Using EW, we can clearly see that we are nearing the tippy top of this raging bull market. From a grand super cycle standpoint alone, my next target comes out to 428.5, and my cycle 5 (not super cycle, too lazy to draw a bunch of lines lol) target comes out to 429.69 (nice).

now, this under no circumstances is saying SPY will peak at exactly 429.69 and begin to trend downward (though that would be pretty fucking funny right, i mean 69? come on, doesn't get any better than that). However, what we DO know is that GME and the rest of the market are correlated.

So, my working thesis is that the top of the stock market is not only predictable, but imminent. Tying this into GME, well, you know the rest.

Speaking of GME, a little update on the waaavvveees:

[4hr](https://preview.redd.it/ps95juwk0c571.png?width=2756&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc84bd970491b8f31d3facb099aea623cec08ad0)

&#x200B;

[1hr](https://preview.redd.it/b7c7cfbm0c571.png?width=2812&format=png&auto=webp&s=79ac4557d86f4ade0aca08e93d85a2feac5a737d)

Do note, we have not actually hit the 61.8% retracement of our cycle 1 (201), we under no circumstances have to hit that for the structure to be valid. In fact, the structure is valid unless we break under 112.83 (bottom of cycle 1), so I wouldn't worry about that at all haha. I'm still waiting for a significant move to give updated GME upside targets, tis a waiting game for now. What's new? Wish I had more time, need more shares.

Regarding SPY, because this is our super cycle, and we are nearing the peak, that means that we must then correct that entire move via an ABC correction, targeting minimum 50% of that entire move. Where does that put SPY when all is said and done?

[SHEEEEEEESH](https://preview.redd.it/bbfh7wzi1c571.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=1502f44228277e07070d84570fd9d8be4752b7b6)

50% of the entire 5 wave super cycle puts SPY at 247.67 (assuming \~ 429 is the top). It could go higher than 429 without a doubt, though i doubt much higher in all honesty.

Alright, I think I covered everything. Thanks for reading and have a great rest of your night!

TLDR: The top of the market is imminent, using EW, we are literally at the tippy top with only a few points till bear market ensues. GME moves inverse the market for a variety of reasons... the market is near the top, GME moves inverse the market, the market is near the top............ mmm yes it's all coming together...

JACKED TO INFINITY!!! BUY AND HODL!!! üöÄ

edit: okay, maybe let's dance isn't the best song to listen to for this, remember the big shorts' ""dont fucking dance?"" my bad, gme exciting, rest of market for everyone not in GME, not so much. Have updated with another banger, also sets the mood :)

not financial advice. I am a degenerate that draws on my computer screen for a living.

I don't even know where to start, other than play this song before reading: [https://open.spotify.com/track/1E0EOstQRm7YMhFpmDJzaB?si=084bbbb871884c54](https://open.spotify.com/track/1E0EOstQRm7YMhFpmDJzaB?si=084bbbb871884c54)

What a day! GME was relatively flat but the broad market was a SHIT SHOW! I have a lot to go over, so strap in and get ready for some pretty colors.

A few weeks back I made [this post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/of4zjh/elliott_waves_gme_wen_the_fck_moon/) going over GME and SPY levels, I believe I said I expected 436 to hit before a sharp selloff. Before going over GME, I'd like to once again update you on my SPY levels.

As an EW trader you have to adapt to structures as they form and let the trends play out, for this reason I am updating my targets. Hate me if you want, the first one hit. I just see more upside from here, but NOT MUCH!

Here's an hourly view, see if you can understand what you're looking at before I explain:

[Hourly](https://preview.redd.it/jhxjyqcoa9c71.png?width=2806&format=png&auto=webp&s=c712dac1994fcf74221cbd84a8d3969ee503a22c)

If you looked at this and came to the conclusion that there is likely more upside, that is correct. This is because if you look at the minute count (white) you can see today was actually a wave 4. Looking deeper, the minuette count (purple, waves within the white wave 3) you can clearly see the 5 waves up, followed by the ABC down to complete the 4.

So what does that mean from here?

Short answer, more upside, at least imho. Today looked to have completed a 4 of 5 of 5 of 5, originally I thought 436 ish would be the top, however after closely exacting the structure, I see one last push. The last hoorah.

Also, put yourself in the shoes of every retail investor that isn't aware of all the bullshit surrounding the markets. They see ""covid delta variant sparks wall street selloff"" and think the market is crashing today.

&#x200B;

If I'm right, I'd expect more green out of SPY from here, to put it bluntly, I see 444, 447, and 460 as final 5 of 5 of 5 of 5 targets. These are spread out as I haven't seen the new trend play out, as it starts to develop we can re evaluate, but these are BASE targets. Could go higher could go lower, or it could just fall and this entire analysis is wrong.

Something to consider, today our C wave (purple, final leg down of wave 4) actually hit a super bearish extension level at 2.618. When this happens, lots of speculation that a downtrend is starting is valid. A tip to see if this is the case, is if this truly is the beginning of a bear market, we **WILL NOT** break above the previous high of our B wave at 436.5 ish. If we break above, think the trend is still bullish, as I expect it to.

Also, the VIX! What a day!

Love to see it, but I wouldn't give it too much attention until it breaks 30. That's when shit will really get interesting.

I'm also expecting the VIX to settle back down into the week, based on gaps and bearish divergence.

Pro tip: when looking at RSI, if the stock makes a higher high on a lower RSI reading or vice versa with lows, we can expect a reversal.

Now onto GME.

real quick before I begin, here's the bull case visualized over the next few weeks/months:

[visualized wave 3 trajectory ](https://preview.redd.it/fwvd807ld9c71.png?width=1872&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbcf56b837d80c199315d69de47ef936cf421b43)

this is just a roadmap assuming all common ratios are hit, which GME doesn't always do as it's anything but a typical stock, but nonetheless, good to visualize and manifest.

short term, this feels exactly like May right before we ran to 344.

Here are possible minuette wave 3 targets

[15m](https://preview.redd.it/pszko3nlf9c71.png?width=2422&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e850fec6835a4c41277a4d93558af22a502a5b6)

Personally, I don't care too much for the intraday action. What I'm happy about is the uptrend is finally holding after a sharp 1.618:1 C wave down from our recent high (154)

I need the structure to play out more before assigning more targets, but as for now, we seemingly completed our minuette 2 at the .618 retrace level

[minuette 2 completion ](https://preview.redd.it/dc76lrdxf9c71.png?width=2022&format=png&auto=webp&s=23de19c90ef57935c24844097a2236e297f5c1c2)

Do note though, it is **possible** this was just the A and B completing. In this case watch for a low of around 157.75 tomorrow. Here's why on a macro scale:

&#x200B;

[15m](https://preview.redd.it/itts1qybg9c71.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11d0312e7dbab3d36027c4ff31ef9e78cc47d9a)

Note the rejection at the .786 level, this is common in B wave retraces. To find our final C target, we can expect in a typical zig zag A and C share a 1:1 fib relationship, putting C at 157.5 from today's high. This is completely invalidated if we break above 179.47, but doesn't rule out a running/expanded flat.

TLDR for this nonsensical macro analysis, buy the dip if there is one.

Visualized:

[1:1 at 157.75](https://preview.redd.it/8scpemaog9c71.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c700f59a9286290dddf687b45011bce60340fe0)

Again, all that matters is higher highs/lows relative to 151. Intraday swings I could care less about, I've been all in this bitch.

The overarching setup on GME is bullish as fuck... 1 2 within 1 2 within 1 2, starting 3 of 3 of 3 now. the fabled elliott tsunami. Let's see if it lives up to my expectations.

Tomorrow marks t+2 for option expiration settlement of the monthlies that expired on 7/16, could be nothing, could be huge. I can promise whatever happens I FEEL nothing.

I leave you with this.

S&P 500 since 1950 - graph showing all crashes,Semcast,2021-02-28 16:15:43,"[S&P 500 Since 1950 - 7 crashes](https://www.tradingview.com/x/v3WOgbWL/)


Hi guys just wanted to put things in perspective for you all since some of you seem to be quite nervous with the recent week of stock movement. 

I've summarised a list all stock market crashes since 1950. There has been 7 stock market crashes since 1950, averaging one every 10 years. 

The stock market crashes ranges from inflation (10%+), to oil price rises (4x) due to war, dot com bubble, housing market collapse, covid-19 etc.

The graph is a log graph meaning that the space changes are proportional to the percentage change. This is useful for looking at long term charts since the % change for a dollar increase is smaller as the index value goes up.

The S&P 500 has averaged a compound annual growth rate of 8.22% since 1950. This is illustrated by the trend lines, and as you can see the S&P 500 is trading right in the middle of the range (the two blue trend lines). 

I noted a few reasons in the box for each crash for a brief understanding of why it had happened. Note, that the only one with a 'fear of overvaluation' was only the dotcom crash where the PE's were over 200 and many companies were just cash burning shells with massive negative free cash flows.

I'm not saying a crash / correction won't happen, but i just wanted to put things into perspective and give a bigger picture of the overall stock market since pretty much before all of us were born. 

By no means am i an economist but I didn't include anything earlier than 1950s because that was pre WW2/WW1 - before the US was a superpower / the global financial hub / USD = world trade currency etc.

Edit: some of you noted that its only 8.22% if you bought at the start but I want to clarify that yes and no! Yes for the people that literally buy in once once at the beginning of 1950.

No because if you buy throughout the years (DCA every month let's say) you'll buy within the range - both lower and higher range! So it's more or less 8%! For example during 1960s-1980s the sp500 traded sideways! So if you constantly bought in those 20 years, the accumulation of money in this period would have a higher CAGR of > 8% because of where it is in the range. Just follow the lines! It makes it easier. There's roughly same amount of periods above and below the middle trend line.

Edit: Changed enron scandal to lehman brothers as some pointed out my mistake.

Edit: Further Log Graph explanation (why log is preferred) If the scale has a large range (i.e. 100 to 3000) then log should be used because its important to show the % changes as opposed to the point changes. A 1 point increase in the SP500 now is only 1/3811 = 0.02% whereas a 1 point increase 10 years ago was 1/1000= 0.1%. It's important to look at it in terms of % change because companies grow in terms of % as well. For example you don't quote apple has grown its business by 30 billion this year ( random number), instead you say apple grew its sales by 20% this year. Its so that its comparable.",4377,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/,0.8873,Positive

Is Retiring at 30 with $700k in the S&P 500 and the 4% Rule a Dumb Idea?,Serious-Buy3953,2024-12-23 04:46:07,"Living in Toronto - Planning to move up north for a cheap(er) retirement

I‚Äôve got $700,000 saved up and it‚Äôs entirely invested in the S&P 500. I‚Äôm thinking about retiring now and following the 4% rule‚Äîtaking out 4% annually for living expenses and letting the rest grow.

I‚Äôd withdraw **$28,000 in the first year,** I‚Äôd adjust the 4% withdrawal for inflation each year to keep my spending power steady.

The math implies as long as the sp500 continues to yield 7-8 percent returns yearly for the foreseeable future, in 30 years the balance will be 3.5 million.

Is this strategy solid, or am I missing something obvious ?

EDIT -  I‚Äôm not withdrawing $28,000 every year. I‚Äôm taking 4% of the portfolio‚Äôs current value each year, so by year 20 I would be withdrawing around $80,000.

"S&P 500 rallies 1% to all-time high, surpassing previous record set in 2022: Live updates",JRshoe1997,2024-01-19 21:20:02,"The S&P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday as investors returned to buying equities in force in recent days following a short-lived market stumble to start the new year.

The S&P 500 rose 1.23% to settle at 4,839.81, surpassing both the prior record intraday and closing highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which set its own record at the end of last year, added 395.19 points, or 1.05%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.7%. The smaller, more tech-focused Nasdaq-100 gained 1.8% to also hit a record high.

All three major averages are now in positive territory for 2024, with the 30-stock Dow going green during Friday's rally.

Following a 19% loss in 2022, the S&P 500 roared back in 2023, posting a 24% gain as the economy skirted a recession that many had expected and inflation came down to levels that allowed the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate hikes. The benchmark came close to reaching a record following a forceful fourth-quarter rally, but ultimately fell short. The market rally paused a bit to start 2024 as investors took some profits in the Big Tech leaders like Apple.

But they returned to buying those tech leaders in recent days. Friday's milestone confirms that the stock market is officially in a bull market that began in October 2022, and not just a bounce within a bear market. The S&P 500 is up more than 35% since that low.

""In the mind of the investor, [companies] leading in AI or having a product set that's differentiated in the tech space are very, very strongly leading the market. That's been a wave that's persisted throughout the remainder of last year and into 2024,"" said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.

The tech sector gained 2.1% on Friday and jumped more than 4% during the trading week, making it the S&P 500's best-performing sector week to date.

Whether the broader market index can maintain its growth momentum in 2024 ""is going to be a question of whether the Fed is able to stick a soft landing or not,"" Stucky said. He noted that the driver of the S&P 500's growth in 2023 was tied to multiples, rather than earnings.

""Multiples rise coming out of economic slowdowns, because investors are pricing in a recovery. If that recovery doesn't materialize, then you do have to question the sustainability of not only holding on to new highs, but making new highs beyond that,"" Stucky added.

Fresh consumer data on Friday indicated that consumers are becoming more confident on the economy and inflation. The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers showed a 21.4% year-over-year jump to reach its highest level since July 2021.

Insurance company Travelers rose more than 5% after posting an earnings beat. Schlumberger gained nearly 2% after beating on top and bottom lines, and Ally Financial surged over 10% after reporting strong quarterly results and a sale of a business unit to Synchrony Financial.

Why is S&P 500 investing the default when the Nasdaq Composite has performed better over every 30 year window?,kbrizy,2025-03-23 14:41:31,"A little Google Finance magic and you can create some plots showing you the ""multiples"" of your money had it been invested for X number of years (I prefer this over unwieldy percentages).

If you invested your money into one index for 30 years that first dollar will have grown by the multiple below. I show two periods the last 30 years, and the 30 years before that:

Period #1 (1995-2025): S&P 500 - 7.6x | Dow Jones - 10.1x | **Nasdaq - 21.7x** ([plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=97885568&format=interactive))

Period #2 (1965-1995): S&P - 5.7x | Dow Jones - 4.6x | **Nasdaq - 8.1x** (plot: [plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=1857506659&format=interactive))

Nasdaq does better. Why are we generally piling into VOO or SPY instead of QQQ or ONEQ?

(I also understand that it doesn't make sense to factor invest into a market exchange, of all things, but what about it makes it more performant over our one true love S&P 500?)



\----  
Edit #1: The astute have pointed out, I cherry picked 2 periods. I ran the rolling/slider analysis and plotted here: [plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=467475738&format=interactive).

It's a little confusing because all the data is being transformed on itself (and rolled into a single number), but here's the interpretation: X-axis represents your ""present day"" and you started investing 30yrs prior to that. Your gains (as a multiple) are shown on the Y-axis above. The chart as a whole represents 60yrs of investing.

\- The Nasdaq wins out fairly significantly, 20x on average, to S&P's \~7x.

\- The Dow and S&P are much older so the data's valid through all the dates we're looking at; the Nasdaq needed to be clipped at 2001 (opened in 1971).

\- Dividends are not included, but someone let me know how to estimate adding 3% (vs 1%) dividends to the total returns and compare that to 20x vs 7x multiples.

Here's how close GME actually is to S&P 500 inclusion,yousaidalligator,2025-03-26 15:38:19,"# S&P 500 Requirements - How GME Stacks Up

1. **US Company?** ‚úÖ
   * Requirement: Must be a US-based company
   * GME: Delaware corporation since 1996
2. **Profitability?** ‚úÖ
   * Requirement: Must have positive earnings in most recent quarter AND over trailing four quarters combined
   * GME: $131.3M net income for fiscal 2024, profitable in recent quarters
3. **Public Float?** ‚úÖ
   * Requirement: At least 10% of shares must be available in public hands
   * GME: Public float of 408.8 million shares out of its total 447.08 million shares outstanding
4. **Listing/Liquidity?** ‚úÖ
   * Requirement: Must trade on NYSE, Nasdaq, or CBOE with adequate liquidity
   * GME: NYSE-listed with multi-million share daily volume
5. **Market Cap of $20.5B?** ‚ùå
   * Requirement: Minimum unadjusted market cap of $20.5 billion
   * GME: 10K states $8.2 billion, but is currently hovering around $13 billion at the time of this post

# The Magic Number: $45.86

That's the share price GME needs to hit the $20.5B market cap threshold (based on current share count). 

Let that sink in - they're profitable, have an absolutely stacked balance sheet with $4.77B in cash (nearly $11/share!), but are being kept out mainly by market cap. For perspective, GameStop's cash position of $4.77B represents over 58% of their last reported market cap. 

The S&P committee can sometimes take a discretionary view on inclusion, but with GameStop's return to profitability and balance sheet, hitting that $45.86 price target could remove any remaining barriers.

# Why is this important?

All S&P 500 index funds and ETFs would be required to purchase GME shares. These funds collectively manage trillions of dollars and must hold all S&P 500 constituents according to their weighting in the index. This would create substantial buying pressure and open GME to a new pool of potential investors.",1040,Superstonk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/1jkep8s/heres_how_close_gme_actually_is_to_sp_500/,0.9841,Positive

"Tesla is 'profoundly overvalued,' and its exclusion from the S&P 500 was a 'brave' decision by the index committee, DataTrek says",Brothanogood,2020-09-10 22:53:20,"Tesla's exclusion from the S&P 500 index on Friday was a surprise to many, given that the mega-cap electric-vehicle manufacturer ticked off all the eligibility requirements.

Tesla on Tuesday fell 21% from Friday's close as investors digested the S&P 500 exclusion amid a tech-heavy market sell-off.

But the S&P Dow Jones Indices index committee's decision to exclude Tesla despite its eligibility for inclusion was a ""brave"" one, DataTrek cofounder Nicholas Colas said in a note on Wednesday.

The decision by the committee could ""only have come from a collective and committed view that Tesla is profoundly overvalued,"" Colas said.

Tesla traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 913x on Wednesday, according to data from YCharts.com. The S&P 500 traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 21.7x, according to JPMorgan.

In addition to a steep valuation, the committee likely thinks Tesla ""sits on shakier fundamentals"" than its August 31 market capitalization of $465.2 billion may indicate, DataTrek said.

That might refer to the fact that much of the profit Tesla has recorded over the past few quarters derives from the sale of green EV regulatory credits to other carmakers that don't meet the mandated annual EV production quota, and not from Tesla's main business of building and selling cars and solar panels.

Tesla will remain eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index if it continues to stay profitable in future quarters.

Instead of Tesla, the committee added Etsy, Teradyne, and Catalent to the S&P 500 index.

The Pressure Cooker

Mainstream Media at best portrays an uninformed, yet ubiquitous, anti-GME campaign. At worst the media is reading teleprompter stories for money. Meanwhile the short thesis is dead. GameStop has zero debt and a profitable legacy business, resulting in $4 Billion in the bank, which equates $0.50/share in interest earnings. ¬†Each GameStop share has around $10/share in the bank.

Pick a Side and Zen

Invest or not? I hope this report convinces you not to risk unlimited losses by shorting this stock. The bankruptcy thesis is more than dead. At this point the drum cadence reminds me of 2008, when the big banks placed and brokered toxic assets into funds and accounts held by everyday people prior to blowing up. I do not think going short is joining the shorts. You are taking their dirty laundry.

¬†

Media Blitz

The Elite messed up in a big way with the events involving GameStop. Why will they not provide an updated short thesis? Why will analysts from the largest news outlets like CNBC not look at this company as more than a ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù? Mainstream outlets disregard the last few years of execution by the leadership of GameStop. They pick bits and pieces that suit their outdated stance and disregard the fundamentals.

Nobody sees it coming. Very few people do their own research these days and even fewer shout contrary opinions from the mountain tops. Well, I do both; I have never been afraid of the demanding work diving into the real numbers. In general, I am confident of my findings even if contrary to the homogenous views of the street.

GAMESHIRE

Warren Buffett started Berkshire Hathaway in 1962‚Ä¶ Oh wait, that is when Warren Buffett purchased his first shares of BPL for $7.60. BPL was the merged Hathaway Manufacturing Company founded in 1888 and the Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company founded in 1889. Today Berkshire Hathaway is the largest holding company and eighth most valuable company in the world at $888 Billion give or take. They have 563,678 shares, and a price of $615,769.00. Warren Buffett owns just over half of the shares outstanding to this day.

GameStop has a young entrepreneur at the helm and, like Buffett, Ryan Cohen took a large investment in a failing business and saw opportunity in the depressed share price. Buffett did not take over the failing textile companies to make rugs, no, he saw intrinsic value in the brands and assets. This is similar to Ryan Cohen‚Äôs early letters to the board and actions with GameStop leadership. While the name Berkshire Hathaway has lived on, it transformed under the young Buffett into the world‚Äôs largest holding company, owning Geico, Coca-Cola, and oh, that Apple company. Now will GameStop succeed as well? Nobody has a crystal ball, however they have a profitable legacy business, and over $4 Billion in capital which they have earmarked for mergers and acquisitions.

Double-Edged Sword

¬†I urge you to spend time on the sub-Reddit Superstonk. I hope you enjoy the dark humor, even lude commentary at times (it is all in playful fun). If you want to learn more about GameStop and how wall street operators get it done. While this report should spark interest, it only scratches the surface of the stand-off. There are greater amounts of information than most finance editorials, tv personalities, or graduate-level finance courses discuss and will teach you at Superstonk. If nothing else, it will show you who and what you are investing in or betting against!

APE stands for All People Equal. APEs were robbed in broad daylight. They are not just a bunch of uninformed investors on a chat board or dorm room, and they did not go away. Their mentality is not ‚Äúforget about GameStop‚Äù or ‚ÄúSell now, ask questions later.‚Äù They watched, learned, and have held through the tricks of wall street, many adding to their positions for years. The popular phrase is ‚ÄúNo Cell, No Sell‚Äù. Even then, some may never sell as they know short sellers are trapped. Investors have educated themselves on other methods to generate proceeds rather than handing their royal flush back to the street.¬†

What if this is all wrong?

If I feel the story or the rebuild goes awry or fails, then I am out. Without a prolonged investment thesis and results, the price will remain suppressed. If I am being honest, the price control can continue until every single share is in book form at the transfer agent. This is happening in real time, and I am happy to explain or answer any questions on the subject matter. ¬†¬†

Hunker Down & Buckle Up!

See this through, enjoy the ride knowing you are on the right side of the trade and history. There will be profits in the broker accounts until there are not. I know most of my investment will never be sold and will remain safe at the transfer agent. The real question is will you be attending the party at the infinity pool?

As a holding company GameStop (Game-Shire) must be looked at on a return-on-capital valuation.¬† They have done a phenomenal job turning around the legacy business to be nothing more than a ‚Äútrue-to-brand‚Äù check mark. I use a weighted average of price-to-cash, price-to-book, and price-to-earnings valuation metrics from current levels and S&P 500 averages.

Wow, what a week. Here‚Äôs a day-by-day summary,

Mar. 28 close at 5,580.94 - Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 üü¢ (0.55%)

Mar. 31 close at 5,611.85 - Apr. 1 close at 5,633.07 üü¢ (0.37%)

Apr. 3 close at 5,396.52 - Apr. 4 close at 5,078.40 üî¥ (-5.90%)

We talked a lot about the April 2 tariffs. The stock market had already priced them in and made a 3-day winning streak for the S&P 500 at the beginning of the week. However, no one expected heavy new tariffs.

As I mentioned in the title, the S&P 500 dropped 9% this week. Its worst week since the COVID crash. Do you remember those times?

Mar. 6, 2020 close at 2,972.40 - Mar. 13, 2020 close at 2,711.00 üî¥ (-8.80%)

As shown in the screenshot, the Information Technology sector took a major hit. Here's index-by-index summary,

üî∑ Nasdaq: 17,322.99

üî∑ DJI: 41,583.90

üî¥ Nasdaq: 15,587.79 (-10.02%)

üî¥ DJI: 38,313.94 (-7.87%)

Day-by-Day Standouts;

üî∏ Monday: The week started with selling pressure due to expectations that tariffs would target all countries. Later in the day, the tariffs would be sector-based rather than country-based. This news helped indexes recover and they gained around 0.5%. üü¢

üî∏ Tuesday: A quiet day. The market awaited more tariff details, but indexes managed to stay on the positive side. üü¢

üî∏ Wednesday: For the second time this week, indexes opened lower following the ADP Payroll Report, but recovered again ahead of the ‚ÄòLiberation Day‚Äô events after market close. Indexes gained over 0.5%. üü¢

üî∏ Thursday: Trump announced heavy tariffs on all countries. This was unexpected and triggered a strong wave of selling. All indexes lost over 5%. üî¥

üî∏ Friday: Before the market opened, China announced an additional 34% tariff increase on U.S. goods. Later, Fed Chair Jerome Powell spoke that the Fed wants to observe the impact of tariffs on prices and inflation. The market didn‚Äôt respond well and selling pressure intensified. üî¥

Before today, the stock market was expecting the first rate cut in June and also they was expecting four rate cuts for this year. This outlook might now change. Money had gone into 10-year bonds and yields down to 4%. Meanwhile, JPMorgan raised its recession probability to 60%.

In the afternoon, Trump commented on China‚Äôs response.

""China played it wrong. They panicked, the one thing they can‚Äôt afford to do!""

Do you agree with JPMorgan? Are we heading toward a recession? How do you see China's reaction and Trump's comment? How was your week? Did you open any short positions or earn from bonds? I didn‚Äôt make any trades this week. What‚Äôs your prediction for next week?

u/moeldevs posted compelling evidence to show hedge funds are paying people to post on reddit ‚Äì [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/pvbcdo/proof_hedge_funds_are_paying_shills_to_post_on/). So, naturally I went digging and found some interesting stuff. Buckle up!

# **The Shill Post**

- As u/moeldeys pointed out, this shill job posting is from a guy named *Doug Yauger*
- Doug Yauger is an Investment Advisor Representative with LPL Financial and a Registered Investment Advisor at [Sovereign Wealth Advisors website](https://sovereignwealthadvisors.com/our-team/doug-yauger/).
- In Sovereign Wealth Advisors‚Äôs [CRS Form](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/crs/crs_188524.pdf), they state their ‚Äúadvisors are registered representatives of LPL Financial LLC (‚ÄúLPL‚Äù), an SEC registered broker-dealer and investment adviser... who offer brokerage services through LPL or investment advisory services through Sovereign Wealth Advisors, LLC.‚Äù
- So, LPL Financial LLC and Sovereign Wealth Advisors are one and the same.

# **Who is LPL Financial LLC and what do they do?**

- LPL Financial Holdings, Inc. [referred to as LPL Financial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPL_Financial) is considered the largest independent broker-dealer in the United States. As of 2021 the company had more than 17,500 financial advisors, over US$1 trillion in advisory &amp;amp;amp; brokerage assets, and generated approximately $5.9 billion in annual revenue for the 2020 fiscal year.
- Hidden in their [financial disclosure section of their website](https://www.lpl.com/disclosures.html) lays their [SEC Disclosures](https://www.lpl.com/disclosures/sec-disclosures.html)
- This is where the good stuff is.
- In these documents, LPL Financial discloses their order flows, including their **Non-Directed Order Flow**!
- What is a **Non-Directed Order Flow** you ask?
- [Financial Dictionary](https://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Non-Directed+Order) defines it as ‚ÄúAn order to a broker to **buy or sell a security on the exchange of the broker‚Äôs choice**. A client has the ability to tell the broker his/her preferred exchange for the execution of orders, which is called [Directed Order]( https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/directedorder.asp). **A non-directed order, however, leaves this to the broker's discretion, with the assumption that the broker will offer or bid the exchange at the best price.‚Äù**
- So, who are LPL Financial‚Äôs brokers/venues? You guessed it, the dirty SHF ‚Äì [link](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/documents/disclosures/rule-606-a-1-iv-disclosure.pdf)
    - **Options Order flow:** Citadel Execution Services and Susquehanna Investment Group LLP
    - **National Market System (NMS) Stock order flow:** Citadel Execution Services, FIS Global Vision Securities, GTS Securities LLC, G1 Execution Services LLC, Two Sigma Securities LLC, Virtu Americas LLC, UBS Securities LLC, FC Stone, Jane Street, Morgan Stanley, Mark J. Muller Equities.
- So, where do you think these non-directed orders are going‚Ä¶cough‚Ä¶robbin da hood‚Ä¶cough dark pool‚Ä¶
- Thanks to DRS, we‚Äôre putting an end to this! 
- But back to LPL‚Äôs dirty laundry...their data!

# **LPL Financial LLC Order Flow Data**

- LPL Financial‚Äôs Order flow data for [1st Qtr, 2021](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/documents/disclosures/lpl-financial-holdings-inc-q1-2021-606a1-held-compliance-report.pdf) and [2nd Qtr, 2021](https://www.lpl.com/content/dam/lpl-www/documents/disclosures/lpl-financial-holdings-inc-q2-2021-606a1-held-compliance-report.pdf) of 2021.
- I‚Äôve taken the liberty to convert this to an [excel file](http://www.filedropper.com/lpl_1) for your convenience (because ape help ape), but also taken a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/naR1AgZ) for you smooth brains out there.
- Helpful order flow definitions:
    - Direct and Non-directed order flow ‚Äì see above
    - **Market order:** An order that will immediately be executed at the best available price. When you place a market order, you‚Äôre looking to get your order filled immediately
    - **[Marketable Limit Orders:](https://ibkr.info/node/194)** Marketable orders are either market, buy, or sell limit orders whose limit price is at, above, or below the current market price, respectively. **Marketable orders remove liquidity from the market.** In theory, these orders are instantly executable as there is a buyer/seller who‚Äôs willing to make a trade at the current trading price.
    - **Non-marketable orders:** Non-marketable orders are buy and sell limit orders in which the limit price is below and above the current market price, respectively. **Non-marketable orders add liquidity to the market.**
- Citadel, Virtu, UBS and G1 Execution dominate the majority of LPL‚Äôs order flow for all the S&amp;amp;P 500, Non-S&amp;amp;P 500 and Option trades.
- LPL‚Äôs **S&amp;amp;P 500 Non-directed order flow data**
    - Citadel was the #1 venue for every month except for June (#2 broker)
    - Citadel averaged **33%** for all their non-directed S&amp;amp;P 500 trades!
- LPL‚Äôs **Non-S&amp;amp;P 500 trade order flow data**
    - G1 Execution and Citadel were #1 and #2 for every month of this year 
    - Citadel averaged **44%**  of all their non-directed Non-S&amp;amp;P 500 trades!
- LPL‚Äôs **Option trade order flow data**
    - Citadel and Susquehanna are the only two brokers trading LPL‚Äôs options
    - Citadel averaged **83%** of all their non-directed Options trades!

# LPL‚Äôs order flow through Citadel visualized for all order types

- [S&amp;amp;P 500 order flow](https://imgur.com/a/Fpvd3tI) 
- [Non S&amp;amp;P 500 order flow](https://imgur.com/a/Gi5Wt8E)
- [Options order flow](https://imgur.com/a/ramkFGx)
- What I find most fascinating is the gap between MARKETABLE and NON-MARKETABLE limit orders during January!
- For January and February, 75% and 65% of LPL‚Äôs Non-S&amp;amp;P 500 marketable limit orders were by Citadel.
- While we don‚Äôt know the volume, we can infer that relative to the other venues, Citadel was the main bottle neck for these perfectly executable orders. I wonder if Citadel removing the buy button on robbin da hood had anything thing to do with this‚Ä¶

# **TLDR** 

- The people hiring people to shill on reddit are SHFs. One of these folks, Doug Yauger, works for Sovereign Wealth Advisors who routes all their orders through and LPL Financial LLC. LPL Financial‚Äôs SEC 606 Rule Report discloses only a few hedge funds manage their entire order flows for stocks and options. Among these is Citadel, which accounts on average 33%, 44% and 83% of all their S&amp;amp;P 500, Non-S&amp;amp;P 500, and Options trade order flows. So, **SHF r fuk.**
- Of note, during the month of January, the marketable limit orders (i.e. trades that could be immediately traded) were grotesquely high at 75% and 65% for January and February for Non-S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks. This may suggest market manipulation by slowing trades and/or re-directing trades to different exchanges (potentially dark pools). This needs to be confirmed however.

Buy, Hodl, DRS!

All you people talking bout the big league. The S&P500. Like they have a set of rules which allows us to just go dick swinging/c\*ntflapping our way in with the big boys and girls.

# The S&P 500

&#x200B;

The big index. In fact one of the biggest indexes in the world, tracking 500 companies which are aimed to benchmark the US economy. (lmayo sure)

&#x200B;

or as they put it....

&#x200B;

>*S&P Dow Jones Indices identifies important industries within the U.S. equity market, approximates the relative weight of these industries in terms of market capitalization, and then allocates a representative sample of stocks within each industry to the S&P 500.*

&#x200B;

Sounds pretty...

*\*forward rolls in\**

***standard...***

&#x200B;

However, this isn't like the Russell indexes. They have a set of rules and requirements in order to transfer in and out of the indexes. The S&P 500? They have an anonymous committee which decide who go in and out.

**AN ANONYMOUS GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS DECIDING WHAT COMPANIES ARE ADDED OR REMOVED FROM ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL STOCK MARKET INDEXES.**

**WHATEVER THE FUCK COULD GO WRONG WITH THAT?**

&#x200B;

Do they have a set of rules? Well yeah, there's some requirements.

&#x200B;

Committee members have a few rules they follow when deciding to make changes in the S&P 500. Companies being added to the index must be highly liquid U.S. firms with a market capitalization of at least $13.1 billion, for instance. **Moreover, the committee has leeway in deciding on changes.**

**So you mean to tell me that they can change the rules anytime they please in order to 'protect the market'.**

&#x200B;

How many times have these people acted in the interests to protect the market? I said in one of my previous DD's, Naked short selling was invented in order to protect investors from Pump and dumps. Look how that worked out.

These people clearly know what to do in order to maintain and prop up the house of cards should individual companies fail to meet the rules. This clearly stops and prevents other up and coming companies from taking their rightful place.

I can't see why this wouldn't be the case again. Who's to say the rules don't all of a sudden change due to market conditions.

STOP listening to this bear, these are not bears, they're clowns, seriously this joke that bears have predicted 17 of the last 2 crashes is not even a joke anymore, this dude is the living embodiment of that statement. Last year during the march-may selloff in 2021, this dude said in an interview that the crash has started, and then the S&P 500 went on to close +26.89% for the year. If you followed this guys advice and held cash in 2010, waiting for his prediction to come true, you'd have waited for about 8-10 years on the sidelines until the market had a selloff in late 2018, or when Covid19 crashed the stock market in 2020. By then you'd have lost much more money on the sidelines, than if you'd just let your money grow in the market throughout all those years. Even if you had just listened to his advice last year during the march selloff and sold, then you'd lose out on being up +26.89% if you'd have invested in the indexes instead of listening to him.

Again stop giving these clowns attention, if the market doesn't crash this year and it starts recovering and people get their confidence back in the market, and we have another rally, this dude will say that the market will crash next year, and if that doesn't happen, he'll say it will crash in 2024, and so on and on and on.

Musk says robots could make Tesla $25 trillion company ‚Äî more than half value of S&P 500 ,Puginator,2024-06-14 02:22:54,"The entire value of the S&P 500 currently stands at $45.5 trillion, according to FactSet. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Thursday that his company‚Äôs Optimus humanoid robots could eventually make the automaker worth more than half of that.

Musk, who characterized himself as ‚Äúpathologically optimistic‚Äù at the 2024 annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas, said Tesla is embarking on not just a ‚Äúnew chapter‚Äù in its life, but is about to write an entirely ‚Äúnew book.‚Äù Optimus appears to be one of the main characters.

Tesla first revealed its plans to work on humanoid robots in 2021 at an AI Day event, trotting out a dancer in a unitard that looked like a sleek, androgynous robot.

In January, Tesla showed off Optimus robots folding laundry in a demo video that was immediately criticized by robotics engineers for being deceptive. The robots were not autonomous, but were rather being operated with humans at the controls.

At the shareholder event on Thursday, Musk didn‚Äôt divulge exactly what Optimus can do today. He suggested the robots some day will perform like R2-D2 and C-3PO in Star Wars. They could cook or clean for you, do factory work, or even teach your children, Musk suggested.

As for shareholder value, Musk said Optimus could be the catalyst for lifting Tesla‚Äôs market cap to $25 trillion someday.

Speaking to a crowd consisting mostly of fawning fanboys in an auditorium at the Gigafactory, Musk promised Tesla would move into ‚Äúlimited production‚Äù of Optimus in 2025 and test out humanoid robots in its own factories next year.

The company, he predicted, will have ‚Äúover 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla‚Äù in 2025.

This is all far-out stuff even for Musk, who is notorious for making ambitious promises to investors and customers that don‚Äôt pan out ‚Äî from developing software that can turn an existing Tesla into a self-driving vehicle with an upload, to EV battery swapping stations.

Getting to a $25 trillion market cap would mean that Tesla would be worth about eight times Apple‚Äôs value today. The iPhone maker is currently the world‚Äôs biggest company by market cap, just ahead of Microsoft.

At Thursday‚Äôs close, Tesla was valued at about $580 billion, making it the 10th most valuable company in the S&P 500.

Musk didn‚Äôt provide a timeframe for reaching $25 trillion. He did say that autonomous vehicles could get the company to a market cap of $5 trillion to $7 trillion.

Musk said he agreed with numbers from long-time Tesla bull Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest. This week, ARK put a $2,600 price target on Tesla‚Äôs stock by 2029, betting on a commercial robotaxi business that the company has yet to enter.

Wood‚Äôs price target equals a market cap for Tesla of over $8 trillion.

Musk‚Äôs comments at the annual meeting followed the shareholder vote to reinstate the CEO‚Äôs $56 billion pay plan, five months after a Delaware court ordered the company to rescind the package. The crowd cheered when the proposal was read aloud, and when preliminary results were announced.

Taking the stage following the readout of the shareholder votes, Musk said, ‚ÄúI just want to start off by saying hot d---! I love you guys.‚Äù

Tesla shares have dropped 27% this year as the company reckons with a sales decline that‚Äôs tied in part to an aging lineup of electric vehicles and increased competition in China. The company has also implemented steep layoffs. Musk has encouraged investors to look past the current state of the business and more toward a future of autonomous driving, robots and artificial intelligence.

Among his boldest claims on Thursday was Musk‚Äôs declaration that Tesla had advanced so far in developing silicon that it‚Äôs surpassed Nvidia when it comes to inference, or the process that trained machine learning models use to draw conclusions from new data.

Nvidia shares have soared almost nine-fold since the end of 2022, driven by demand for its AI chips. The company is now worth about $3.2 trillion.

One concern swirling around Musk is his focus on Tesla given all of his other commitments. He owns and runs social media company X, is CEO of SpaceX, and founded The Boring Co. and Neuralink. He launched another startup, xAI, in March last year and the company recently raised $6 billion in venture funding.

Musk was asked by a shareholder at the meeting how important he is, personally, to the future of Tesla.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a helpful accelerant to that future,‚Äù he said, emphasizing his role in innovation.

He said that, when it comes to humanoid robots, other companies, including tech startups, are going after the market. Competitors include Boston Dynamics, Agility, Neura and Apptronik.

‚ÄúWhat really matters is, can we be much faster than everyone else and our product be done a few years before theirs and be better,‚Äù Musk said.

"Tesla, snubbed by the S&P 500, quickly completes $5 billion stock sale",MoesBAR,2020-09-08 20:14:32,"The old Wall Street adage is to ""sell high."" Tesla did just that.

A week ago, Tesla announced it would sell $5 billion worth of stock at market prices ""from time to time."" Tuesday it announced it had completed that sale as of Friday.

The exact number of shares sold, and thus the average price of each sale, was not disclosed. Tesla shares have fallen sharply in the recent sell-off of tech stocks. Shares reached a split-adjusted record high close of $498.32 on August 31, but have lost 16% of their value since then through Friday's close. And shares were down another 11% in pre-market trading even before the Tuesday's filing.


The sell-off could be because Tesla was not added to the S&P 500 index, as many investors were expecting would happen, given its market value and recent record of sustained profitability. Being added to the S&amp;amp;P would have forced additional purchases by fund managers whose holders must mirror the blue chip index.

Shares of Tesla are still up about 400% since the start of the year, even with last week's sell-off.

The sale of stock is the second such offering Tesla has done this year to take advantage of the skyrocketing stock price. In February the company raised $2.3 billion through the sale of 3 billion shares. Adjusted for the recent split, that stock sale was at an average price of $151.60 a share.

CEO Elon Musk dismissed the idea of the need for sales of additional shares when asked about it by analysts in January.

‚ÄúWe're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly,"" Musk said on a January 29 call, when the company posted its first annual profit. ""There is no artificial hold back on expenditures ... So in light of that, it doesn't make sense to raise money.""

But soon thereafter Tesla decided it didn't make sense to not take advantage of its climbing share price. And if it turns out that its shares hit a peak last week that it might not reach again for a little while, then Tesla apparently sold additional shares at close to that high point.

# SUMMARY:

* **1) Here's my post from the last time I got a screen recording of this happening in real time:**
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/t9l129/video\_massive\_sp\_500\_3474\_billion\_vol\_glitch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/t9l129/video_massive_sp_500_3474_billion_vol_glitch/)

&#x200B;

* **2) At 11:20:01 AM EST today, Mar 23, 2022:**
   * S&P 500 volume ""glitches"", increase of +108% on the day

&#x200B;

* **3) Total observable volume spike:**
   * \+672.2 Million spike to 1.296 Billion total volume on the day
   * Not that much of a spike right? Keep reading :)
   * Note: At first, Daily Avg volume is NOT affected

&#x200B;

* **4) At 11:20:25 AM EST, \~24 seconds later:**
   * \+672.2 Million spike is removed, volume drops back to *actual* 623.8 Million
   * At same time: Daily Avg ***increases*** (by 29 Million) from 3.847B to 3.876B and ***STAYS THERE*** even though the volume spike was clearly completely removed
   * **It would take MASSIVE, ""INVISIBLE"" VOLUME to cause the average to jump like that**
      * ***EDIT1: And wouldn't you fucking know it: Wall Street On Parade today w/ this article:***

      * *(FYI: I used archive link bc WSOP domain is blocked on Reddit)*
   * *Also: Charts available again. Hooray /s*

&#x200B;

* **5) All this,** **not to mention:**
   * The observable volume spike shouldn't have even been enough to cause the Daily Avg to increase in the first place
   * Remember, the spike only brought the total to 1.296 Billion, when the Daily Avg was already 3.847 Billion
   * If any change to the Daily Avg could possibly have made sense, *it should have been a* ***decrease***, *NOT an* ***increase***

&#x200B;

* ***6) EDIT2: (Copy/Paste from last post bc maybe there's something to*** ***this comment*** ***from*** u/NotBerger ***below):***
   * [""Assuming apple draws their data from some continuous feed there should be no reason for the hiccup and missing chart Wat doin??""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/tl3jff/comment/i1tnbbb/)
   * *And from my last post:*
      * *Does anyone know what the signal is that feeds charts out across all tracking apps & sites? And who is responsible for feeding it out (and has ability to cut if off)?  If we could ID those things, maybe there's a way to watch for when the signal is up & when it's down, which could be a very telling indicator in and of itself... Knowing these pieces of info could also create an incredible opportunity to shine the bright light of accountability on this bullshit by encouraging key entities to sit up and answer for it every time it happens, the same way following the money back up to its source brings shady shit to light.*

I dear the right wingers to justify this,Flat_Bath_1547,2025-04-04 14:23:56," Tariffs negatively impact the U.S. economy by driving up prices for imported goods, which raises costs for businesses and consumers, leading to reduced spending and slowed economic growth. For companies that rely heavily on global supply chains, such as tech and automotive industries, the increased costs from tariffs squeeze profit margins, discouraging investments and hiring. This uncertainty unsettles investors, often resulting in significant stock market declines, as seen in steep drops in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Retaliatory tariffs from trade partners limit access to international markets, hurting U.S. exports and compounding economic strain. The combined effect of higherproduction costs, reduced consumer demand, and fear of a trade war leads to a widespread loss of investor confidence, causing financial markets to lose value and intensifying economic instability.

Just to add some Crypto bros are fuming rn

How many people manage to beat S&P 500?,Delicious_Reporter21,2021-10-31 14:25:55,">Active management is bad and it‚Äôs getting worse.¬† Every year, S&P Dow Jones Indices does a study on active versus passive management.

The S&P, after all, has dipped below its 50-day moving average.

And when it does that, the index often goes on to drop at least another 5%, which happened in 2023 and twice during 2022.

The next major level of buying support, as has often been the case over the decades, is the S&P 500‚Äôs 200-day moving average at 4671, a 6% drop from current levels.

DeepSeek Puts Tech Stocks on Track for $1 Trillion Wipeout,s1n0d3utscht3k,2025-01-27 10:40:06,"> Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America‚Äôs technological dominance.

> Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek‚Äôs latest AI model being cost-effective while running on less-advanced chips, casting doubt on the validity of the rich valuations for companies like Nvidia Corp., which has led the global AI stock boom as its chips have been seen as essential to the technology. 

> Shares of [Nvidia] slid 10% in premarket trading on Monday. 

> Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled 3.4%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell 2% as of 5 a.m. in New York. 

> In Europe, tech stocks led market losses, with shares of chip equipment maker ASML Holding NV down 11%. 

> The Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, spiked higher. The Nasdaq 100 and Europe‚Äôs Stoxx 600 technology sub-index were together set for a market capitalization wipeout of roughly $1 trillion, if the losses hold.

> Roughly 200,000 Nasdaq 100 futures contracts changed hands by 4:45 a.m. New York time, about four times more than the 30-day average for this time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

> AI trades slumped elsewhere as investors rethought assumptions on computing power and energy.

Even real returns?We‚Äôve been on a bull-run, sure, but these calculations take into account the dips and our current high, which still show average returns over those years (when it should be the upper bound of what an investor can expect). So if we use that as our likelihood of high/low returns for the next decade, we can say that the likelihood of high/low returns aren‚Äôt that much higher than any other point in time. If anything, it doesn‚Äôt seem high, just slightly above average. For reference, what I consider good returns are like 5-6% real, not what the last couple years brought.

With all the news and articles I‚Äôm seeing, people think the US is doing too well as always when in reality we‚Äôre doing basically just as well even with the most profitable industry in history (tech).

*Correction: 11% real average returns since 2011 are quite high, yes, but that‚Äôs from the bottom of the dip to now. And if we zoom out, the bottom of the last 2 dips to now give us more modest returns. My point in picking the bottoms of every 10 year period was to showcase the upper bounds of returns.*
